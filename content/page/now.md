- Using Bullet Journaling to organize my day-to-day life ([latest status report](/weblog/2023/03/05/two-months-with-a-hobonichi-techo/)) but now also started combining it with the ["Second Brain" method](/weblog/2023/05/10/building-a-second-brain/).
- Very much into fountain pens and Traveler's Notebooks & Midori MD products.
