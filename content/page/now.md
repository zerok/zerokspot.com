- Working at Grafana Labs.
- After having used bullet journaling for a while, I've now [switched back to OmniFocus](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2024/08/27/rethinking-my-productivity-system/) for work and personal task tracking.
- Very much into fountain pens and Traveler's Notebooks & Midori MD products. One day I really want a Plotter ðŸ¤ª
- Having subscribed to too many podcasts and fighting with the backlog there...
- Making my way (after all these years) through [Continuous Delivery](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/77eb0975-4194-42e7-9db3-005d4250940f) by David Farley and Jez Humble.
