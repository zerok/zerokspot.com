0.5rem 0"> I'm a software developer from [Graz, Austria][graz], where I'm
currently working for [Grafana Labs][gl] on the Release Engineering team.
Previously, I had worked for [Netconomy][nc] with Java on [hybris/SAP
Commerce][]-based e-commerce solutions and with [Sencha touch][] and
[ReactJS][] on frontend projects.

Before that I studied Computer Science at the [University of Klagenfurt][uniklu].

In my spare I help organising [GoGraz][] ([Go][] Usergroup Graz). Previously, I
was the organiser of the local [Python][] user-group in Graz, [PyGraz][].
Outside of these two languages I'm also trying to get into [Rust][] right now
and enjoy getting to know new technologies and helping out in the
opensource/free software community whenever I get the chance.

Oh, and I really love [attending conferences][conf] ðŸ˜‰
