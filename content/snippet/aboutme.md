0.5rem 0"> I'm a software developer from [Graz, Austria][graz], where I'm
currently working for [Grafana Labs][gl] on the Platform team.
Previously, I had worked for [Netconomy][nc] with on e-commerce solutions
various frontend and backend technologies (too many to list here).

Before that I studied Computer Science at the [University of Klagenfurt][uniklu].

In my spare I help organising [GoGraz][] ([Go][] Usergroup Graz). Previously, I
was the organiser of the local [Python][] user-group in Graz, [PyGraz][].
Outside of these two languages I enjoy getting to know new technologies and
helping out in the opensource/free software community whenever I get the
chance.

Oh, and I really love [attending conferences][conf] ðŸ˜‰
