0.5rem 0"> I'm a software developer from [Graz, Austria][graz], where I'm currently working
for [Netconomy Software & Consulting GmbH][nc]. While I started there as a Java
developer working on [hybris][]-based e-commerce solutions, after a couple of
years I moved over to more frontendy grounds where I did projects with
[Sencha touch][] and [ReactJS][]. Right now I'm working on our internal tools,
services and frameworks 😃

Before that I studied Computer Science at the [University of Klagenfurt][uniklu].

In my spare I help organising [GoGraz][] ([Go][] Usergroup Graz). Previously, I
was the organiser of the local [Python][] user-group in Graz, [PyGraz][].
Outside of these two languages I'm also trying to get into [Rust][] right now
and enjoy getting to know new technologies and helping out in the
opensource/free software community whenever I get the chance.

Oh, and I really love [attending conferences][conf] 😉
