title: Nine Inch Nails publishing new album online (DRM-free)

<img class="left" src="/uploads/ghosts_120x90_1.jpg" alt="" />Wow, kudos to Trent Reznor and the rest of the *Nine Inch Nails* for doing something that you have [probably](http://mashable.com/2008/03/02/nine-inch-nails-album-download-free-ghosts/) [already](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/03/nine_inch_nails_album_released_online/) heard about: They put their new instrumental album (or collection, depending on how you look at it) *Ghosts I-IV* [online](http://ghosts.nin.com/main/home), giving you 4 different packages to choose from, depending on what you want (no CDs, CDs, CDs and Blu-Ray disc ...). For details, check out the [order options page](http://ghosts.nin.com/main/order_options).

-------------------------------

Personally, I first got the free package, since for me it's been always a little bit risky with the Nine Inch Nails, but I soon found at least 2 tracks out of the 9 that I couldn't stop listening to for a whole day and a half (with the rest also need being bad ;-)). And for 5$ it wasn't really that hard to convince myself that even if I only found one more track from the rest of the 36 tracks, it would be more than worth the money given the current USD2EUR conversion rate ;-) 

The package that I got also include 11 wallpapers (each in normal as well as widescreen ratio), a 40 pages PDF with some more photography and a bunch web graphics like the one you see above.

Another big part of that move is, that everything there is released under a [CreativeCommons (share-alike, non-commercial)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) license which allows you for instance to create remixes with the tracks. 

Again: Big props to NiN and I really hope we will see more stuff like that from other bands out there.
