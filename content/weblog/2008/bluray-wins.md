title: Blu-ray wins ...

... and I still don't really care. Yesterday the rumor came up, that now
also *Paramount* might be on the edge of [switching](http://gizmodo.com/341983/hd-dvd-really-dead-now-paramount-following-warner-to-blu+ray+only-party) from the HD-DVD into the Blu-ray camp
thanks to some contract loophole. This basically makes Universal, as far as
I can [see](http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/01/06/blu-ray-pretty-much-wins-format-war/), the only bigger studio left which supports HD-DVD. 


-------------------------------

Still, does this mean that Blu-ray will be a success? At least I don't really
see myself buying Blu-ray discs within this year simply because I don't
have an HDTV and DVDs simply do what I want right now while being a whole lot 
cheaper. For instance the "Bourne Ultimatum", that's supposed to
hit stores in 2 days, costs on Amazon.de right now 14.95EUR on
[DVD](http://www.amazon.de/Das-Bourne-Ultimatum-Matt-Damon/dp/B000VE1T4Q/) 
and 27.95EUR on [HD-DVD](http://www.amazon.de/Das-Bourne-Ultimatum-HD-DVD/dp/B000YKOMLE/).
Since I watch movies primarily through the DVD player on my MacBook on my
19" TFT-monitor the HD-DVD version (or Blu-ray if it were available) wouldn't
offer me anything that the DVD version couldn't give me.

[Some people](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/08/game-over-hd-dvd-to-join-deadpool/) also wrote, that this battle isn't even all that relevant with
digital distribution gaining more and more momentum. Well, perhaps for them.
For me, not even digital distribution is for now not relevant when it comes 
movies, simply because it's really hard for people outside of the USA to
get content this way. The movie industry is about to make the same mistake as
the record industry and stay with a region locked system (or a market 
segmentation with regional licensing agreements) on a market that's
supposed to have no borders anymore except for the language barrier. 

**Update:** Seems like the rumor around Paramount was [nothing but a rumor](http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/08/paramount-current-plan-is-to-support-the-hd-dvd-format-curre/) (at least for now)
