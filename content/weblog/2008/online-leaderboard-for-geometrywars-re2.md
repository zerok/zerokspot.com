title: Online leaderboard for Geometry Wars RE2
---


Nice, Bizzard Creations has now also put the [leaderboard for Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2](http://www.bizarrecreations.com/games/geometry_wars_retro_evolved_2/#leaderboards) online. Flash ... but better than nothing :-) Now I just have to get a higher score in all, I guess, all modes. Lurking around in the lower 50,000 isn't all that nice.

I already thought that my 800 MS space bucks were already well invested, but with an online leaderboard, I really have to start getting into the higher score-ranges ... Sometimes achievements simply aren't good enough.
