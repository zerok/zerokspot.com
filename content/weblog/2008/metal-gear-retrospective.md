title: Metal Gear Retrospective
---


GameTrailers did it again: Release a simply great series of retrospective features and in this case, about the [Metal Gear franchise](http://www.gametrailers.com/retrospective.php#Metal%20Gear) thus far.  In 5 episodes the viewer gets to know all the MG games including not only the relatively recent and well known (thanks to the Playstation) "Solid" games, but also the original games as well as portable episodes like [Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops](http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mpo/) and one of my personal favorites: The *AC!D* series ([1](http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mga/english/index.html), [2](http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mga2/index.html)). 

But be warned: Most of the videos aren't really what you'd call spoiler-free (perhaps except for the *Portable Ops* one). 

If you think about getting [Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots](http://www.konami.jp/mgs4/global/index.html) and haven't played all the MG-games, then this might be something for you. It definitely convinced me to get a copy of *Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops* (and the expansion pack for this game) today. Let's see if I can finish at least the original game before the Euro2008 ends (which is when I plan to get a new TV and MGS4 to inaugurate the new HDness) ;-)
