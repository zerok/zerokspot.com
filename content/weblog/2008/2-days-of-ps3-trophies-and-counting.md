title: 2 days of PS3 Trophies and Counting
---


For the last 2 days I've now been hard at work getting some of the<s> achievements</s> trophies which are now available in some PS3 games since the last firmware update. And since the only game I have that supports trophies, I've been playing tons of *Super Stardust HD* again :D After getting the first 2 for finishing the first 2 levels, I noticed that for most of the trophies you have to get the expansion pack which costs 3.99 EUR. Since I wanted to get it anyway, that's not a big deal for me, but I still think its weird and a bad idea, to be honest, to make only about half of the trophies for the core game.


-------------------------------

But apart from this issue, it will be a really hard decision from now on, for what system to get a game. Previously, it was quite simple: If the versions were the same except for the Xbox360 version having achievements, it would always have been the Xbox360 version I would have bought. This will probably make a nice 180 when I finally get an HDTV. Then I will have identical gaming-quality with both consoles but the PS3 will be far less noisy ;-)

The interface on both systems is pretty simple, although I prefer the XMB over the Xbox360 user interface. A nice addition to what Microsoft offers is a percentage indicator telling you, how many percent of the trophies you've already got. Apart from that, there isn't all that much of a difference in functionality between these two. In both you can easily compare your stats with your friends, see what achievements you've got and so on. In the XMB it seems a little bit more straight forward though, especially when you're the game you want to see your stats for.

I also like the whole tier system with bronze, silver, gold and platinum trophies indicating their difficulty ... if it's used appropriately. In Super Stardust HD there is for example a silver trophy for surviving more than 7 minutes in the Survival Mode. Good luck getting this one. When I checked the high-score list last night, only 12 people world-wide managed to survive more than 7 minutes... Should something like this be really just a silver trophy? Or is the platinum trophy not the only one with some special requirements?
