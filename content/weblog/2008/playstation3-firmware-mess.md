title: Playstation3 Firmware Mess
---


You sometimes really have to wonder, what Sony is doing. For the better part of the last 3 years gamers have been whining about the Playstation 3 not offering any kind of Achievements. Then they [announced](http://kotaku.com/5017378/sony-announces-in+game-xmb-trophies-coming-to-ps3-via-240-firmware) so-called "Trophies" about a month ago for the upcoming firmware 2.40 release just so that you know that all your current games appear not to support any Trophies (except for Super Stardust HD). 


-------------------------------


When the moment came the firmware came and was gone faster than I could even start my PS3 ... What had happened? Well, seems like QA had had some weeks off and therefor no-one ahd really tested the new firmware.&lt;/sarcasm&gt; The biggest problem people were facing appears to be that they couldn't even [get into the XMB anymore](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/02/sony-responds-to-adverse-firmware-2-40-effects/) after booting. Then Sony [pulled the firmware](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3168527) from their servers again. 

Now I was really looking forward to a weekend full of Super Stardust HD -- since you have to replay the game in order to get the trophies -- but now, I guess, I have to wait for at least another week to get to it. Let's just hope that it doesn't take Sony all that long to really fix those issues.

On the other hand there are also some positive things to report: It seems like Sony noticed that Trophies would only be nice if they were actually also applied to their back-catalog. Now [Uncharted](http://feeds.joystiq.com/~r/weblogsinc/joystiq/~3/325033032/) is also supposed to get them. Hopefully just the first of a huge list of games to get PS-Achievements :-) Still, this whole process was just a complete mess. On what systems was QA and testing that firmware if they could miss a problem of this magnitude?
