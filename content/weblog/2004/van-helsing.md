I've just come back from the cinema where Wuzzn and I watched <em>Van Helsing</em> with Hugh Jackman. It's really a nice movie with some (at least for me) new ideas for the whole Dracula/Vampire scenario (I won't give any details, otherwise I'd have to mark this entry as Spoiler ;-) ).

--------------

Although this movie is from the same producer as <em>The Mummy</em> it is by far not as funny as the adventures about the toilet paper monster(s). Only Helsing as sometimes a funny saying or two but that's it. The action definitely dominates the movie. The special effects are nice and the locations look well constructed.

Also Van Helsing's antagonist Count Dracula , played by Richard Roxburgh, is very stylish. Overall the cast of the movie is good as is IMO the script. Only Dracula's wives got on my nerves all the time. I mean, come on, mighty beings like Vampires that are in direct connection with the mightiest of their kind but still act like 5 year olds? Well, <strong>they</strong>'ve got to live with that \*g\*

I think, who liked the two Mummy-movies will probably also like <em>Van Helsing</em>. Here you get everything just now in Transilvania: automatic crossbows, instant stakes, nice girls (yeah, this time more than just one *g*) and so on. Okay, <em>Van Helsing</em> isn't as funny as any of the two Mummies or the Scorpion King but this time the action and the animations/effects are better.
