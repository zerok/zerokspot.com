I’m currently playing primarily Pokémon Shield for the Nintendo Switch but [since yesterday](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/27/the-last-campfire-comes-to-apple-arcade/) I at least know which game I’m going to play next. Two days ago a new game appeared in Apple Arcade: [The Last Campfire](https://thelastcampfiregame.com/) by Hello Games, the developers of No Man’s Sky for the PS4 (among other platforms). There is little about the story that can be deduced from the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu8_Q44BIPA) alone but it looks like an emotional adventure filled with puzzles in order to bring hope and life to your civilisation.

The game is available for [Apple Arcade](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-last-campfire/id973039644), Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Since I already have an Apple Arcade subscription I’ll probably be playing it on my iPad with a PS4 controller… If I continue like that I probably will never finish Kirby…
