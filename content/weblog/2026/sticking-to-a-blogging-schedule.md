For the longest time I’ve just written on this blog without any particular plan. Especially last year this has led to quite a few longer times of inactivity. For the new year I’ve decided that this shouldn’t happen again. The blog helps me think more deeply about certain topics and I’ve really missed that focus.

Since December I’ve now been working down a list of blog posts from a schedule/calendar. One post per week and I decide in advance (but on the preceding Sunday at latest) what should appear here by the following Sunday.

## Creating a backlog

Theoretically, this will allow me to work on multiple posts in parallel so that I can build up a backlog. I could then pick up posts from there and finish in weeks where I don’t have time to start something new. At least that part hasn’t worked yet, but it will 🙂

This is also the main reason why none of my recent posts have been long or overly detailed. I simply don’t have the backlog yet.

## Low-tech

The organization for all this happens inside two pieces of paper of my [bible-size Plotter](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2025/05/05/not-a-plotter-review/). One for the schedule where I have a list of all the weeks of the coming months, another where I write down broad ideas for posts.

Every week I try to fill up the next couple of weeks with those ideas and thereby decide what I’m going to work on next.

I then go into [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) where I write all the drafts, sharing them via iCloud so that I can work on these wherever I go. Initially, I thought I could keep on using Obsidian for that, but with everything else going on in there, it’s far too distracting. In iA Writer I just have these drafts and nothing else.

## A look ahead

Luckily, I’ve collected quite a few things I want to write about and even for some started creating drafts. It’s also fun to combine the blog schedule with my journal and calendar to identify in advance topics that might appear in the near future!

I’m hoping that this will finally get me to write more frequently here again. Times are definitely not boring and so there should be enough things to put to Markdown 😂
