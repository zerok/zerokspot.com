Due to some family issues traveling was very limited in 2025. Besides the usual trip to Brussels in February for [FOSDEM](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2025/02/09/fosdem-2025/) and another one to Edinburgh I didn’t go beyond Austria and border regions.

Right after Edinburgh I think my highlight last year was a trip to Salzburg, where I accompanied my partner on a business trip. The evenings were free and we also had two days to explore the city and the countryside with our bikes. If you like great food, biking, and beer, Salzburg is an absolute recommendation! Be prepared for wet days, though.

Since I had to take care of my parents, most of my trips happened around Graz and Klagenfurt. We still also went to Lindau for a couple of days. Due to construction work, though, we couldn’t go directly. Instead, we decided to do a little side tour through [South Tyrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol) using our bikes and regional trains. Next time, I will have less luggage with me but everything else about that detour was just perfect 😂

Between Klagenfurt and there our train also had a quick stop in [Möllbrücke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurnfeld). The mountains just looked amazing and so we thought it might be worth a proper visit. Through a coincident we really made it and noticed a small mountain in the North-West of the town which should offer an amazing view over the whole area. We were not disappointed:

Coming to think of it, I think we made the best of the situation and just had an amazing time wherever we went! Still, I really hope that 2026 will be a little more ... organized 😂
