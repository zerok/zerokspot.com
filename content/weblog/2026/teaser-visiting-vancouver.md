While I had other plans for this week’s post, work and exploring Vancouver didn't really allow for any kind of preparation. It’s my first time on the Canadian west coast and while I’m sad that I’ve missed this year’s FOSDEM, I enjoyed Vancouver *a lot*! A detailed post will follow in the next couple of weeks but I definitely need to at least share some pictures with you!
