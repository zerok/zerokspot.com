Another year has come and so it’s once again time for a book reading challenge! Last year I had sat the bar quite low with 15 books. After many times I simply wanted to actually complete the challenge again. Turned out, even 15 books was quite hard and I had to fill in some graphical novels towards the end which had been on my list anyway.

For this year I’ve decided to be a bit more daring again and am now aiming for 20 books. I already know that some of the books will be Doctor Who graphical novels, so this might still work!

Besides that main one, I will also look for other reading challenges hosted by [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) over the course of the year. In January, for instance, there is the “January Pages Challenge 2026” where you need to read at least one page on every single day of the month. In the past I had a lot of days or even weeks without reading any books. Somehow I ended up feeling like I could either read or play games. With these challenges I want to force myself to still make some progress in a book while also doing other things.

Onwards into an exciting year full of books!
