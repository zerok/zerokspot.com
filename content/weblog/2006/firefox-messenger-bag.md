Don't have a messenger bag yet and want to show the world that you're a

-------------------------------

Firefox user? Then the official [mozilla.org store](http://store.mozilla.org)

has something for you: The [Firefox Ogio Messenger Bag](http://store.mozilla.org/product.php?code=MZ34014).



Actually the bag looks really nice :) From what I can see on that site this is

basically Ogio's [Hip Hop](http://www.ogio.com/product.php?product=96) bag 

just with the Firefox logo on it :) There are just two things I don't like 

about this deal:



1. There is no information wether that bag is made of water resistant 

   material or not.

2. The bag is not available in the Non-American store :-(
