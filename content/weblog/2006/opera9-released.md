title: Opera9 released
---


Today [Opera](http://www.opera.com) Software released version 9 of their webbrowser. This version comes with an integrated Bittorrent client, ad blocker and site specific preferences (et al.). The browser has a new rendering engine that also passes the [ACID2 test](http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2).

-------------------------------



The only downside Opera still has for me, is that their email client still doesn't support Socks5 proxies, so I can't use it. Apart from that, the browser is _really_ fast. The only problem I've noticed so far is in [Performancing Metrics](http://performancing.com/metrics) where I can change the date or range using the nice calendar interface.
