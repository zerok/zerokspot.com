Starting next week, [some regions in Austria will be in lockdown again](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000131120039/zusperren-in-etappen-der-weg-zum-bundesweiten-lockdown). Officially this is limited to folks who haven’t been vaccinated yet but nobody knows yet how something like that could ever be checked or even enforced. In the end, it will just be either a complete lockdown or no lockdown.

The situation is quite dire right now. The number of new infections is exploding with [more than 13,000](https://www.derstandard.at/jetzt/livebericht/2000131122049/1000248038/oesterreich-wird-fuer-deutschland-hochrisikogebietampelkommission-fuer-regionale-lockdowns) within the last 24 hours which puts us on the 4th place within the EU and ICUs are nearly at capacity. At the same time the only aspect of importance seems to be that [Germany has now issued a travel warning](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000131096498/berlin-erklaert-oesterreich-aufgrund-corona-lage-zu-hochrisikogebiet) and our winter tourism season is in danger…

Why are we where we are? Delta, nobody giving a damn about keeping their distance, nobody actually checking your certificates outside of just scanning the QR codes with their eyes (the “Bundesheer method”), [PCR tests that can be done at home](https://test.zmdx.at/) (at least in Styria) are only sent to single lab that is most likely already beyond its capacity, people in Salzburg and Upper Austria who refuse to get vaccinated and their politicians being just … I guess I should stop here. I’m starting to lose all patience with those in our society, that eat the cheapest meat they can find which is probably full of experimental meds but refuse to get vaccinated during a pandemic with something that has by now been tested by billions.

If you can vaccinated and a doctor doesn’t tell you otherwise, please finally do!
