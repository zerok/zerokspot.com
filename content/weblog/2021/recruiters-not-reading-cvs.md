Quite a few of the recruiters that have contacted me over the years obviously never read my CV or even looked at the list of jobs that I’d be interested in on LinkedIn while contacting me via LinkedIn… 

Last week, a [u/AngelinaTheDev](https://www.reddit.com/user/AngelinaTheDev/), frustrated with getting their (it’s quite likely a throw-away-account, so I’m not going to assume a gender here) applications rejected too many times set out to [check if recruiters were even reading her CV](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this_resume_got_me_an_interview/). At least in their experience, more often than not this seemed not to be the case. Initially, the CV sounded reasonable but all link were RickRolls: 90% of their applications were answered.

Then AngelinaTheDev went all in and put some questionable achievements into the resumé. Just some of the highlights:

- “Spread Herpes STD to 60% of intern team”
- “Team coffee maker”
- “fraternity record of most vodka shots in one night”

Oh, and according to the CV AngelinaTheDev’s also an expert on Mia Khalifa alongside C++ and JavaScript. There are so many details hidden in that resumé 🤣 None of that seemed to have any effect on the response rate according so far…
