In [Chuck Wendig](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/)’s latest book [“The Book of Accidents”](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/project/the-book-of-accidents/) you follow the story of the Graves family consisting of Nate (father), Maddie (mother), and Oliver (son) as they move from the city to Ramble Rocks into the house of Nate’s father after him passing away.  Right away, strange things start to happen: Animals behaving erratically, Nate seeing the ghost of his much-hated father, Maddie while working as artist on a statue having a black-out, Oliver meeting a boy that look for some reason extremely familiar…

Over the course of the next around 500 pages you are sent on a ride through parental abuse, mystery, murder, and even to some degree sci-fi. The story went into a lot of directions that I didn’t expect without losing me. Luckily, it was still not hard to actually keep up as there are few (if any) idle chapters.

One thing to keep in mind here, though: It is a horror book with quite a bit of gore and lots of murder. On the other end there are also lots of mystery, fantasy, and even sci-fi elements in here to make it interesting for nearly everyone (who isn’t put off by a bit of gore). I really enjoyed this book despite me needing a month to finish it (I blame Dead Cells)!
