Last week I had the chance to go to [my previous home-cinema](https://www.cineplexx.at/mobile/center/cineplexx-villach/) in Villach after nearly 20 years and watch [“The Suicide Squad”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suicide_Squad_(film)). Unlike the rest of my viewing party I really enjoyed Harley’s latest adventure on the fictional South American island nation of Corte Maltese. It was goofy, funny, and, as was to be expected, over-the-top violent. Personally, I’d hoped for a bit more story but wasn’t really expected all that much on this front. I was definitely there for the action and the goofiness 😉

The casting, too, was just great once again with Margot Robbie returning as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, and Peter Capaldi as evil scientist Gaius Grieves. Nathan Fillion also had a short role as T.D.K.. I could have done, though, without the underwear scene with John Cena as Peacemaker 😂

A quick word about the age labelling of the movie, though: The Cineplexx in Villach showed the FSK 16 variant. For some reason, though, the one in Klagenfurt advertised it as suitable for 12 and older. Personally, I think FSK 16 is “fine” but the [MPAA rating of R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system) is more suitable. There is a lot of gore in here but at least outside of one or two scenes no torture or psychological abuse.

Concluding, I had a lot of fun with the movie but I also pretty much knew what to expect. Personally, I prefer Harley Quinn’s solo-movie “Birds of Prey” from 2020 but “The Suicide Squad” is a great combination of madness, action, senseless violence, and humor.
