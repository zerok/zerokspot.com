Yesterday, Sony held one of their ["Showcase"
events](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/showcase/) again where they presented
what's on the horizon for the PlayStation 5 when it comes to games. You can
watch the whole thing on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VtfD2i3rc)
but my personal highlights were...

- [Forspoken][f], a game by Square Enix that is currently scheduled for spring
  2022 which kind of looks like Infamous but moved to a fantasy world with
  dragons and magicians.
- Marvel's [Wolverine][w] is getting a game made by Insomniac ‚ù§Ô∏è
- And finally there's going to be a new [God of War][g] game once again set in
  and around Norse mythology. I should really start playing the predecessor for
  the PS4 that I've had shrink-wrapped for the last 2-3 years now üò©

Sadly, my level of excitement is still limited due to still not having a PS5.
I've now put myself on some more waiting lists but this whole situation is not
ideal right now...
