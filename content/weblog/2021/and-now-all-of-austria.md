[Since I posted last][i] about the situation in Austria, much has happened: Starting last night there's now a [lockdown][l] for everyone across Austria older than 12 who hasn't been vaccinated or has recovered but every region is now free to get more restrictive if they think it to be necessary. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for getting rid of the pandemic but why things like health care are regional and not federal issues is beyond me, but that's Austria.

That being said, there are even rumors that we might even get a complete lockdown for everyone or at least a curfew at night.

Oh, and now the leader of the far right party FPÃ–, who advocated against masks and for medicine related to deworming livestock, has now [also contracted the virus][k]. While I wish everyone who's infected all the best, I cannot stop laughing about [this article on DieTagespresse.at ("Austrian Onion")][t]. I should really finally get a subscription there.
