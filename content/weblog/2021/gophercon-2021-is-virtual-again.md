When I first heard that [GopherCon US](https://www.gophercon.com/home) might be going physical again this year, I was both excited and also a bit sad. Excited because I loved the one physical GopherCon I could attend back in 2018 and sad because I was pretty sure that I wouldnâ€™t be able to make it San Diego this year thanks to Covid. 

Turns out, I wonâ€™t have to! I completely [missed the announcement](https://twitter.com/GopherCon/status/1438912704929046538) but similar to last year, GopherCon 2021 is going to be online again and thanks to their sponsors the community tickets for this GoVirtCon 2.0 are free!

So, if you have time from Dec 6 to Dec 10 and can survive the time-difference (16:30 - 00:30 Europe/Vienna) then do yourself a favour, grab a ticket, and join GopherCon 2021 ðŸ˜€
