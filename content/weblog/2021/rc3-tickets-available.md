For anyone who has some time to spare between 2021-12-27 and 2021-12-30  (besides liking tech or security or privacy topics) there will once again be the [online version of the yearly Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/2021/12/01/rc3-presale/) happening! Due to COVID-19 it was not possible to do the event in person but last yearâ€™s rC3 was so amazing that I cannot wait for this yearâ€™s edition! 

Tickets are now available on [https://tickets.events.ccc.de/RC3-21/](https://tickets.events.ccc.de/RC3-21/)! The standard ticket is free but if you want to financially support the organisers thereâ€™s also a supporter ticket where you can pay as much as you like (but please more than just â‚¬1 ðŸ˜‰).

All talks will be available also without a ticket but then you wonâ€™t be able to join the complete experience. Last year there was [a whole online-world](https://rc3.world/) with local community events and more, so itâ€™s definitely recommended to get a ticket! Note that the ticket does *not* come with [waffles](https://c3woc.de/) and a crate of [Flora Power](https://flora-power.de/). These youâ€™ll have to buy on your own ðŸ˜…
