Last week, during our journey to The Netherlands, we also made a one-day trip to The Hague. There I simply couldn’t get around also going to [P.W. Akkerman](https://akkermandenhaag.com), one of the most known pen stores in Europe. I had previously ordered from them online but after seeing some pictures I had to just go there while in the area.

The wall behind the counter alone had so much to look at, it was hard to focus on the reason why I even went there: I wanted a [TWSBI Precision Gun Metal](https://www.twsbi.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/twsbi-precision-gun-metal-fountain-pen). Ever since I first saw this pen on Reddit I knew it would be a really nice fit. Once in my hand I wanted to have it even more as my everyday-pen. It’s kind of a combination of the [580ALR](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/02/11/new-pen-day-twsbi-diamond-580alr-nickel-gray/) and a [Kaweco AL Sport](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/09/20/kaweco-al-sport-fountain-pen/), brining the solid, hefty feel to a TWSBI piston filler. And while I really like the nibs of these two other pens, the EF nib here feels even more smooth.

I just love it and it even works **very** well with the Platinum Carbon Black ink which is exactly what I’ve been looking for!

Back to P.W. Akkerman: While I browsed the store, I noticed that they also have a large selection of notebooks with a whole shelf rack dedicated to Leuchtturm 1917 products including their new 120g series! I guess in a couple of months I will even get to even try it given that I just started a new journal inside a Rhodia notebook...
