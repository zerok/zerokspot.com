to reading I'm a little focused on SciFi ... but just a little bit ;-) But now there is something to help me to get
over this: **[The ADN Book Club][abc]**!

The concept is quite simple. Once a month a book is selected from a list of [suggestions][sug] by [voting][vot]. Then
everyone who wants to participate has one month time to read the book. At the end of that month (on the last Saturday)
there will be a discussion. I haven't seen any details yet, but I'd assume that this discussion will simply center
around the hashtag [#bookclub][bch]. Right now there are still format discussions going on there, so you might want to
follow this tag until everything has been ironed out.

While I'm not sure I will be able to fully participate (due to time constraints and tons of other books I still have in
my backlog), I at least want to read the sample chapter available on Amazon.com with every book. And if I like a book,
usually there that can stop me from finishing it ;-)

So on to the book due on December 29: ["Those Across the River"][tar] by [Christopher Buehlman][cbu]. Normally I'm not a
big fan of books taking place in the past, but that's just the reason I want to take part in a book club: Reading
outside of my little box :-)
