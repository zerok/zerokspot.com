title: New Book about Progressive Enhancement
---


<img src="/media/2011/bookcover.jpg" alt="" class="left" />Just read on [Jeffrey Zeldman's blog](http://www.zeldman.com/2011/06/02/progressive-enhancement-all-you-need-to-know-is-here/) about a new book about progressive enhancement in web design by [Aaron Gustafson](http://aaron-gustafson.com/) and available on [easy-readers.net](http://easy-readers.net/). It only has about 130 pages but at only $11.00 it was an instance purchase for me since I've been looking for quite some time for some great books about this topic. Once I'm through with it I will definitely write a review :-)
