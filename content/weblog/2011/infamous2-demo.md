title: inFAMOUS 2 demo is out!
---


<img class="left" src="/media/2011/logo.jpg" alt="" />So the PSN Store is finally also
online again in Europe and the first thing I did yesterday was to download the
[demo](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/06/01/infamous-2-demo-out-now-midnight-sales-and-mlg-event/)
of [inFAMOUS 2](http://www.infamousthegame.com/en_US/infamous2.html), the
successor to [one of my favorite games in
2009](http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/06/07/infamous-review/). The demo is
really nice since, once again, you get a sample of missions for the good as
well as the evil Cole and can mess around with enemies as well as the slightly
post-apocalyptic environment.

I'm still not sure that I like the new characters models or the new voice
actor for Cole but the game plays great and I really need another great open
world game, so I'm definitely looking forward to this one. Especially, after
playing such a nice demo :-) If you have a PS3 you should definitely at least
try the demo. It even includes a recap of the first game for those of you who
missed it.
