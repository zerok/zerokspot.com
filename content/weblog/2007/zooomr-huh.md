title: Zooomr ... huh?
---


Thanks to [Flickr](http://flickr.com)'s handling of the whole censorship issue (or lack thereof), many people are now asking for alternatives and quite often [Zooomr](http://zooomr.com) get mentioned. Could anyone please explain to me, what's so great about it, because I don't get it. Yesterday I created a new account there just to see what this is all about. 



-------------------------------



To sum up what I noticed so far and what problems I've faced:

* I created an account _not_ using OpenID and now I seem not to be able to edit my profile. So where can I now change my password, my e-mail address and so on?
* It's great that you have "Learn more" and contact links ... if they'd work and not just throw a 404 message.
* So now I logged out ... forgot my password and can therefor dump my whole account? Or have I just missed the password-recovery link?

I hope I've just missed something here, because otherwise this would simply look like a big joke.
