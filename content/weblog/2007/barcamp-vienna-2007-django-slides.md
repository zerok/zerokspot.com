title: Barcamp Vienna 2007 - Django Slides
---


In case you were at the Barcamp and couldn't check out my little presentation about the [Django web framework](http://www.djangoproject.com/), couldn't read the slides or simply couldn't get to the Barcamp at all: Here are my slides (and even hopefully with less errors ;-)).

-------------------------------

<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=121834&doc=introducing-django3449" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=121834&doc=introducing-django3449" /></object>

The sourcecode to these slides as well as the code for the promised demo application can be downloaded using the [bzr](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) versioning system from following path:

**<http://bzr.zerokspot.com/barcampvienna-2007.09/>**

(or as a [snapshot](http://bzr.zerokspot.com/barcampvienna-2007.09.tar.bz2))
