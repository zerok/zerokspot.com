title: Location Metadata in Lightroom
---


If you're like me and wondering how to set the location correctly in order to get rid of all those "Unknown ***" fields in the metadata browser ...

-------------------------------

... you have to first of all change the mode of the metadata setting in the right sidebar. As the respective "Unknown" fields in the browser indicate, you can use at least 4 different metadata fields: Country, State, City and Location. So now you have to choose from the available masks one that includes at least those 4. In the default installation of Lightroom 1.1 you have 3 masks available that offer these fields: **All**, **IPTC** and **Location**.

You can now select one of these in a small drop down field next to the Metadata area in the right sidebar (I use the German edition of Lightroom, but it should still be obvious what area is meant).
