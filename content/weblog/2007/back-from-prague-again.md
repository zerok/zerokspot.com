<a class="left" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/1312957652/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1203/1312957652_0d4575a069_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="DSC_1956.jpg" /></a>For the last 2 weeks I've been touring with my parents around Germany and the Czech Republic, which should explain the lack of content in this period. But it also means something else: Tons of stuff to write about.

-------------------------------

First of all it also means tons of photos. I think after filtering I will end up with roughly 40 photos per day (!). I will also try to write reviews on at least all the hotels and pensions we stayed at and all the restaurants we ate at. I guess I have enough to work on for this month then. 

Apart from this I also read a book and played (after months of ignoring that platform) a PSP game I want to write about. So perhaps I will be able to finally post something every day again :D
