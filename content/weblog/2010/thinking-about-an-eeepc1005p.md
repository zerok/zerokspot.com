title: So thinking about an EeePC 1005P
---


It&#39;s funny: For the better part of the last 2 years I&#39;ve been avoiding all the hype about netbooks, but now, in the week of Steve Jobs perhaps changing the game once again, I kind of want one ... and if it&#39;s just for coding while watching TV on my couch or in a caf&eacute;. So, I&#39;ve been looking around a bit and at first was nearly ready to just order a Dell Mini 10v because of all those stories about how easy it is to get Ubuntu running on it. Not to mention that it&#39;s currently on sale on Dell&#39;s website. But a two year old CPU and a pain-in-the-butt method of upgrading the RAM? I don&#39;t really mind messing around with some hardware for upgrading it it, but if there is something even better, easier to customize and ... newer, I&#39;m all for it :-)

Late last night, in some kind of semi-comatose state, I noticed a new EeePC on the website of a local retailer. The <a href="http://gdgt.com/asus/eee/pc/1005p/">1005P</a> is available right now (at <a href="http://www.e-tec.at/new/info.php?n=detail&amp;art=42899">E-Tec</a>) for less than 280EUR, which is really nice for an Atom N450 powered netbook. I, obviously, can&#39;t really compare that to other netbooks, but the specs look really nice :-)

What&#39;s holding me back right now is twofold: First I naturally wait for what will get announced in Cupertino, but second and more important: I&#39;ve so far read enough success and failure reports by people trying to install Ubuntu on it to wait a little bit and see what&#39;s really going on. There are stories like <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1389772">this one</a> where the user can&#39;t get crucial elements like the keyboard to run and then there are more than just <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks#Asus%20Eee%20PC%201005PE">a</a> <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1390856&amp;highlight=1005p">few</a> reports that state that nearly everything is working properly out of the box. The most <a href="http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/atheros-ar5b95-geht-unter-unr-9-10-nicht/2/">problematic</a> part seems to be the wifi adapter. Weird... I thought the graphic chip might cause more trouble, but so far most people seem to fight with network driver issues. I guess, I realy should wait a few more days ;-)
