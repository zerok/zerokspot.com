title: New properties editor in Obsidian 1.4
---


With version 1.4.0 Obsidian got a new and improved way to edit properties of notes. While you previously had to write the frontmatter by hand, the new properties editor finally renders those properties nicely on top of the note-body and also adds lots of shortcuts and auto-completions around properties you've used before.
