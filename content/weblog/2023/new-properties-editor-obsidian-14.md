title: New properties editor in Obsidian 1.4
---

With version [1.4.0](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2023-07-26-desktop-v1.4.0/) Obsidian (for Desktop) got a new and improved way to edit properties of notes. While you previously had to write the frontmatter by hand, the new properties editor finally renders those properties nicely on top of the note-body and also adds lots of shortcuts and auto-completions around properties you've used before. There are also new commands like "Add file property" that make manipulating the frontmatter a breeze!

At the point of writing this, the new editor is only available through Catalyst builds and only on Desktop. I cannot wait for it to become available in the mobile version ðŸ˜€
