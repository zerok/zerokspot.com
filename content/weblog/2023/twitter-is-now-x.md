This is just sad: Elon Musk now really [killed the Twitter brand and logo](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/musk-rushes-out-new-twitter-logo-its-just-an-x-that-someone-tweeted-at-him/), replacing everything with just "X". Gone are the days of the cute bird logo. Well, using the fail-whale would be too self-conscious anyway...

On the bright side "the internet" already has quite a lot of fun here with announcements like "wayland.social being the successor to x.com" ([source](https://wayland.social/@compositor/110768798303454842)), a joke that most Linux users should get.
