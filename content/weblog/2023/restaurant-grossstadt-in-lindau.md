Sorry, one more restaurant review from Lindau (Germany), but I think this will be the last for a bit ðŸ™‚ This time it's about a small place called [Cafe/Bar/Restaurant GroÃŸstadt](https://grossstadt-lindau.de) close to the centre of Lindau Insel:

While looking for vegan & vegetarian options we stumbled upon this place which offers (among others) wraps and bagels in vegetarian, vegan, and non-vegetarian variants. I had a great wrap with salmon, served with salad and a large serving of fries as a side. This might have been among the best wraps I've had in a while! We also had a delicious and a soup called "Energiesuppe", which was very spicy but pleasantly so!

The place in general is also just very comfortable and cozy, always with a candle on the table and everything nicely decorated. Next time I'm in the area I will definitely try to make time for it again! One thing to keep in mind: They only accept cash but there is a bank two streets away ðŸ™‚
