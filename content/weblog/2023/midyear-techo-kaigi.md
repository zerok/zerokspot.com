With the first six months of 2023 now already over, I think it‚Äôs time to look back at [my original planner plan](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2023/01/01/my-techo-kaigi-for-2023/) and check what worked and what didn‚Äôt there. I already did a [revision in March](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2023/03/05/two-months-with-a-hobonichi-techo/) and it turns out, I stuck pretty close to that since then.

## Personal task management

As already hinted at in the post in March, I moved the task management aspects out of my Hobonichi planner into a [Traveler‚Äôs Notebook passport-size](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-passport) with [dot-grid inserts](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/refill-passport/refill-p-014). Here I use two booklets: One for regular task planning including weekly lists and one for long-term planning and projects that should stick around for longer than 6 months.

I'm still experimenting with the format, switching back and forth between a classic bullet journal (weekly + daily) and a week-focused format with a modified Alastair-style.

## Journaling

This is now the sole domain of the [Hobonichi Planner A6](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2023/all_about/planner/). Memories and especially highlights and lowlights are tracked here. I also wanted to add more photos to it but apart from two events that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. That being said, I still want to do it and ‚Ä¶ just need to do it üòÖ Ignoring that, though, I think the Planner works really well for this use-case. I couldn‚Äôt do actual planning with it, though, as I require some kind of weekly step where I can just add things that I want to get done that week without pinning it to a specific day.

## Work planner

Here I‚Äôm still using the [MD Notebook](https://md.midori-japan.co.jp/en/products/mdnote/) (A5, gridded, inside a Roterfaden Taschenbegleiter) that I set out to use for that. It continues to work well especially in combination with floating Alastair bullet journaling. Rapid logging isn‚Äôt necessary for this use-case, only task management. I try to always to a bit of a review at the end of every  week and lay out a plan for the next week on the last day.

Overall I'm quite happy with the setup although I sometimes miss the flexibility of an A5 notebook for my personal planning/bullet-journaling. Perhaps I will still be able to get my hands on an A5 Plotter for next year üòÅ
