Last night marked the end of one of my favorite apps: [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io), a Reddit client for iOS. In case you missed all the drama that led to its end, you can read at least some of it on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754183/apollo-reddit-app-shutting-down-api). I will miss it. Without it I doubt I would have started using Reddit (after having had a dormant account for years) and discovered all of the great communities that exist there. While the official Reddit app has gotten much more usable over the years, Apollo was in its own league there.

Apollo was just a victim of a much larger struggle and fight,though, that Reddit admins are now leading with lots of the moderators and users over there. No idea how this will end or what Reddit will look like after it. But I’m pretty sure it will not be the same without Christian Selig’s awesome app!
