Over the last couple of months Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that the current cadence for the [GoGraz](https://gograz.org) meet-ups is just not sustainable for me. During this monthâ€™s event, Dorian and I had a quick chat and we decided to start a little discussion on Meetup.com, collecting ideas and wishes regarding how GoGraz should work in the future. We have some ideas of our own but first it would be awesome to hear from those of you who attended the meetups in the past or who couldnâ€™t but wanted.

For the time being, we have also removed all new events on Meetup.com that were previously created according to our monthly cadence. If we have time for an event and also content, we will just create one just-in-time  ðŸ˜€

So, please let us know either through [this discussion on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/graz-open-source-meetup/discussions/6755397672136540/chat/) , [Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/CJQ3JSN82), or just send send me a mail as comment for this post!
