I sometimes really have to laugh about how different companies define the concept of a family or household. In Amazon’s case a “household” (or “family” in some of their UI) consists of [exactly two adults and up to four children](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html%3FnodeId%3DGEX2D6QN8PKQJAJ2). Only the adults can have full accounts while the children are just profiles.

This works up to the point where you have a teenager that would like to buy their own stuff but still wants to have access to the “family library”. In short: This doesn’t seem to work as there seems to be no way to add a third adult to the household.

The only workarounds we’ve found so far is that the teenager has to switch between various accounts or that if we want to buy them a book we have to use the “Buy for others” feature. I was really surprised to see that [Apple’s Family Sharing](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/22/how-to-share-apple-books-with-family-members) feature is much more usable there which is yet another reason for me to buy books from Apple if they are only available in a DRM’d way…
