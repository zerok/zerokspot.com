Sorry, it took me a while to find the time to write a little recap of what happened at [this monthâ€™s GoGraz meetup](https://gograz.org/meetup/2023-03-20/). Well, I gave a presentation about how you can collect tracing data using the [OpenTelemetry Go SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/). I also included a quick demo forwarding the tracing data to Grafana Cloud for rendering and how error cases can be represented there (using error events).

If this sounds interesting then you can find all the material including my slides on [github.com/zerok/gograz-demo-otel](https://github.com/zerok/gograz-demo-otel) ðŸ™‚

I would like to use the opportunity to also thank [GoBridge](https://github.com/gobridge/about-us/blob/master/README.md) for providing us with a Zoom room once again!
