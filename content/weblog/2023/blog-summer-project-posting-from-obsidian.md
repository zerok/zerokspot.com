Over the last half a year Obsidian has become the place where I collect knowledge for the long run but also turn to for writing drafts. The only target for which I don't yet create the drafts for in Obsidian is my blog and I want to change that now.

This will most likely involve writing a simple plugin that can just push a note to a HTTP endpoint and a custom server that creates a pull request out of that content. I'm actually already quite far here after coding on a train a couple of days ago and one evening before that 😄

Another benefit of moving to Obsidian is that I now longer have to invent my own syntax for handing frontmatter data, as I did when using Ulysses. In short: I can't wait to have that implemented and operational! 😁
