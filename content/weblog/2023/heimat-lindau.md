While wandering through Lindau a couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon the restaurant [“Heimat Lindau”](https://www.heimat-lindau.de/home/) and I really don’t know how I could miss this cozy restaurant the last time I was in the area. Heimat offers wide variety of meals with also quite a few vegetarian but also non-vegetarian options. The monthly specials also included things like a chestnut soup and seasonal burgers. On Friday and Saturday evenings Heimat also offers a happy-hour for cocktails which were also very tasty!

Given that the restaurant is very cozy - it even feels like a lounge in some areas - it’s hard not to start with a nice meal in the afternoon and then stay for the cocktails! Definitely a place I will visit again on future stays in the city!

The only downside I could find was that the toilets weren’t clean and also partially damaged.
