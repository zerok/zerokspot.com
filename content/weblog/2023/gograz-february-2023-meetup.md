Sadly, [this monthâ€™s GoGraz meetup](https://gograz.org/meetup/2023-02-20/) didnâ€™t go as planned. I originally wanted to give a quick introduction to adding tracing to Go applications using OpenTelemetry (together with Grafana Tempo).

A few folks, sadly, had to cancel on short notice and right at 19:00, when the meetup was about to start, Meetup.com had some outage so even if people wanted to come, they couldnâ€™t get to the Zoom link. After waiting for 20 minutes in the call to make sure that really nobody would come, I cancelled the call. If you tried to join but simply couldnâ€™t and had no way to contact me (due to the Meetup.com issue), Iâ€™m really sorry and hope to see you next month! ðŸ˜¢

On a positive note, we now have at least one talk in the backlog for next month! That being said, if you want to give a presentation or just have a topic you want to hear about, please create a ticket on [https://github.com/gograz/ping](https://github.com/gograz/ping)!
