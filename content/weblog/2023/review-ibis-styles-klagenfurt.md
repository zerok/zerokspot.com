Last weekend we were in Klagenfurt to enjoy the latest programme of Austrian Kabarett artist [Alex Kristan](https://www.alexkristan.at). Since the show took place at [Kärntner Messen](https://www.kaerntnermessen.at/) and we arrived via public transport at the main station, we decided to stay over night at [Ibis Styles Klagenfurt](https://all.accor.com/hotel/B3Y1/index.de.shtml), which is just around ten minutes on foot from the main station and five from the fairground.

Unlike other hotels of that chains I’ve stayed at in Paris, Ibis Styles Klagenfurt is far more spacious and offers more amenities. We had a family room which allowed for up to four guests. That room was just huge (around 40m²) with a large double-bed and a large couch-bed, all very bright, modern, and comfortable.

The hotel on the 2nd floor also has a large breakfast area with a great breakfast buffet including bacon & eggs, waffles, and lots of various cereals ❤️ Very good value for €17 per person.

Unless you want to stay close to the lake you should definitely give this hotel a try if you plan to stay for a couple of days in Klagenfurt!
