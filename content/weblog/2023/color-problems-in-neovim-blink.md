While trying to configure a RaspberryPI as a development machine for use with my iPad, I ran into a weird issue: When I connected using [Blink.sh](https://blink.sh) and Mosh, NeoVIM for some reason had completely broken coloring with background colors being extremely intense green/blue instead of ... grey ðŸ˜‘

Turns out, truecolor support was only added with [Mosh 1.4](https://mosh.org/mosh-1.4.0-released.html) last October. Ubuntu 22.02 didnâ€™t have that (obviously) and so colors via SSH looked fine but were broken via Mosh. Luckily, thereâ€™s a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~keithw/+archive/ubuntu/mosh-dev) available that makes dev-builds available which fixed my problem!
