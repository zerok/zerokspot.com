Alongside this yearâ€™s [GrafanaCON](https://grafana.com/about/events/grafanacon/2023/), which is going to be an online again, there will also be a lot of local events all over the world. One of them will be held in Vienna on Tuesday, 2023-06-13 starting at 17:30 at Zimmermanngasse 8, 1090 Wien. Thereâ€™s going to be a presentation of Grafana 10 followed by some Q&A.

Looking through the list of sign-ups also a lot of Austrian Grafanistas are going to attend, so if you prefer in-person chats over Slack/Discourse, this will be a great opportunity ðŸ˜„
