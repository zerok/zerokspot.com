title: Rest in Peace, Kris Nóva

Right while doing a quick break this morning and scrolling through my Mastodon timeline I ran into [this message by Joe Beda](https://hachyderm.io/@jbeda/110922766367332571):

> Last Wednesday evening [@nova](https://hachyderm.io/@nova "nova") had a climbing accident and died. \[…\]

I met [her](https://krisnova.net/) only once at a GitHub event that she had organised during FOSDEM 2023 and hadn't known her before so I cannot talk in length about her achievements or her as a person. The only thing that I can say is that I kept watching [Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io) and the [The Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org/) from the sidelines and was (and still am) extremely impressed. There are so many other pieces of her work that I'm not aware of but even without those she will leave a huge hole in the community!

To her friends, family, and closed ones: I'm very sorry for your loss and wish you all the best!
