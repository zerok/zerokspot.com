Over the last couple of months my relation ship with social media in general has felt like a roller coaster but in general, it's just a bit too much again. While I still enjoy my little corner of the Fediverse also thanks to apps like [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp) (more on that perhaps in another post), the demise of Twitter and the recent (private) launch of BlueSky has changed something in the community.

I see more and *more bashing*: Of other networks like BlueSky in this case, other languages (just take a look at the golang-tag which contains a lot of content where people just found yet another that their preferred language X "does better" than Go), or simply *other things* in general.

This is tiring. Don't get me wrong: I'm not looking for a feel-good social network but I don't want to spend the time I have available doom-scrolling through heaps of non-constructive bashing. Having "single" streams right now doesn't work for me that well anymore.

I'm not yet at the same point of frustration as [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/anti-social-update), but think I might eventually get once again to the point where I will be extremely selective about the mainstream social networks and just focus on some subreddits (like r/fountainpens) and websites that I can consume through my feed-reader. Neither of these stress me and I can just look into whatever topic I currently care about without also having to scroll through tons of other areas.

At the same time, I will probably also reduce the number of accounts I'm following on the fediverse and treat it more as a communication and discussion medium than as something I use to active look for "news". 

Whatever approach I will take, I think I have to change something about my social media consumption and this sounds like a decent first step.
