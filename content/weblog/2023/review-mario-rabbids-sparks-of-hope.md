After reading a couple of books I wanted to take a little break again and started playing [“Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Sparks_of_Hope) on the Nintendo Switch. I quite enjoyed the previous game in the series ([“Kingdom Battle”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Kingdom_Battle)) and the new one promised some interesting changes to the otherwise strictly round-based strategy-game formula, so I just had to give it a try. One big change here is that the levels are no longer grid based but you can freely move around and use slide-attacks and similars to hit your enemies before using your character’s primary abilities. And yes, every character has their own unique abilities and characteristics, making it quite fun to mix and match (and upgrade)!

The game makes you travel between 5 (+1) planets in order to free the “Sparks” (which are basically shines you might remember from the Super Mario Galaxy series) and Ubisoft’s Rabbids. They are currently hunted by an evil entity called “Cursa” who has also brought lots of Bowser’s minions under its control.

Each of these planets has usually two main story missions and lots of small side-quests in order to free sparks and acquire new skins for your weapons. There is a lot to do here and the levels are fun to explore. On the first couple of planets you also get new abilities to unlock various other areas of each planet. It would have been awesome if also the other planets had some new gadgets to unlock even more hidden areas later in the game, though.

That’s also the only thing I can complain about here. I’ve had a real blast and spent nearly 40 hours in my quest to free the sparks from the Cursa’s grip.
