Looking for some great wraps in Bregenz (e.g. while waiting for a train at the nearby train station)? While walking through the city we ran across the newly opened [New York Bagel & Bowls](https://www.newyorkbagelbowls-bregenz.at). They offer a range of bowls, bagels, and wraps including vegan and non-vegan options. So far I've only had their wraps but they were delicious and well-filled. Combined with friendly service it has definitely made it onto my list of places to keep in mind when visiting Bregenz!
