If you’re like me and are sometimes struggling keeping an overview with weird road signs and markings, then most of the signs that have been documented by [Gaku Yamazaki](https://trafficrinsan.jimdofree.com) all over Japan, probably won’t help you either. That being said, they look awesome and are quite indicative of how complex road systems have become that someone thought they had to try to also adapt road signs accordingly.
