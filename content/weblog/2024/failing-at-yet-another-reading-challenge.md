title: Failing at yet another reading challenge
---

For 2024 I had set my reading challenge to "only" 20 books. "Only" because this was already a step down from the 30 that I had tried and succeeded in 2020. Since 2020 I've failed to reach my reading goal every single year. So right now I'm at 13 books with at least a chance to finish 2 more before the end of the year but that's about it.

I don't really know why. I have access to pretty much all the books that I wanted to read but somehow I just couldn't focus on reading them at least during the first half of the year. It took me also on average nearly a month to finish a book. Perhaps I should start reading multiple books in parallel again: One fiction, one non-fiction.

I'm not sure if this will help, though and so for 2025 I think I'll go down to 15 books and just celebrate any book that goes beyond that. This should at least safe me from reading too many comics and O'Reilly reports ðŸ˜…
