title: Lamy acquired by Mitsubishi Pencil
---

What a weird day. First that [weird stuff around Automattic](https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/) and now this: [Lamy just announced that they had been acquired by Mitsubishi Pencil](https://www.jottacloud.com/s/3162e03874ad59641d4bc46b5de760b6503). This came out of the blue for me and I don't have any extreme feelings about it. I have tons of products from both companies (although probably more different ones from [Lamy](https://lamy.de) thanks to many Safaris and AL Stars etc.) and enjoy them all!

It just feels weird to see a company as old and widely known as Lamy to be acquired. This also means - as far as I can tell - that Kaweco is the last larger German fountain pen company that still has German owners (albeit the ownership there is also a bit strange ðŸ¤ª).

At this point, I'm mostly curious how it will turn out! Uni-ball has some awesome products on the rollerball and mechanical pencil front but I always liked the style of Lamy products! Just imagine a mechanical pencil with the inner workings of a Kuru Toga but in a Lamy cp1-like shell. Or even better: Uni-ball ink refills for the pico or xevo ðŸ˜„ I can still dream ðŸ˜‰
