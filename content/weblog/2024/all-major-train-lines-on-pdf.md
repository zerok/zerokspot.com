title: All major passenger train lines on a PDF
---

Thanks to [the Kraftfuttermischwerk](https://www.kraftfuttermischwerk.de/blogg/weltbahnkarte/) I stumbled upon this awesome map of all major passenger train lines **world-wide**! When you travel around, you usually only see the regional network but  [Zhaoxu Sui zoomed out and create a map connecting them all](https://zhaoxusui.github.io/2022/05/22/World_Passenger_Rails/)! The result is two maps: One simplified version that covers only train lines and a highly detailed one that also includes busses and ferries where trains are not available. 

Looking at these maps I just want to start crossing the lines off that I've already used, knowing that I will, sadly, never get them all ðŸ˜…
