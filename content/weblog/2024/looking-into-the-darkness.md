When I woke up on Wednesday morning, I was shocked. I had not expect the US election to end up this way and with such a lead. I'm lucky in that regard that, whatever comes next, will affect me only indirectly.  In my head there are tons of scenarios how bad this all going to get, but just playing around with these won't help anyone.

At the same time, the effect on my little bubble of the net was drastic. Everything moved from hopeful to end-time in moments. Not really surprisingly lots of tech CEO started to ["kiss the ring"](https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder). They are still obligated primarily to their shareholders and so it totally makes sense to play with symbols and please someone who might become even more powerful in the next couple of months.

I imagine things will change online. That was apparent from the first day after the election. People will think twice before they post anything politically in public spaces online. This is probably the best time to point to you this [excellent article by Molly White](https://www.citationneeded.news/wind-the-clock/) and also to [the Surveillance Self-Defense guide by the EFF](https://ssd.eff.org).

At the same time, I'm still hopeful. People can do amazing things and I still hope that we will notice that working together instead of against each other, helping instead of hating, is the right path before it's too late.

Good luck to us all.
