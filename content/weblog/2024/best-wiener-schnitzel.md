title: Best Wiener Schnitzel
---

[As I wrote before](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2024/12/07/a-quick-trip-to-vienna/), I went to Vienna earlier this December among other things to meet some coworkers. Since we also had two guests from Hamburg, I wanted them to have some original "Wiener Schnitzel". The place where we went had a good schnitzel but I've had better. 

Two days ago I now took a bus to Klagenfurt to celebrate Christmas with my parents and we went to [Gasthaus im Landhaushof](https://gut-essen-trinken.at/der-landhaushof/) for an extended lunch. I was bold enough to order a (veal) Wiener Schnitzel there and, honestly, it was probably the best schnitzel I've ever had. It was far better than the one I had in Vienna due to it not being paper-thin but also simply because the meat quality was on a completely different level. 

Now I just wish we could do next year's Christmas meetup there ðŸ˜…
