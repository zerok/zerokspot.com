title: Reviving GoGraz
---

Last Tuesday we had the first Go meetup in Graz for 17 months. Back in May of the last year I was simply completely out of energy. We also couldnâ€™t find enough talks to keep the event going at its monthly interval, jumping in when possible but due to health issues it was just too much and so the summer break tuned out to be over a year long.

For the 10th anniversary Dorian and I are now trying to bring GoGraz back! We had a long discussions on Wednesday with lots of ideas and topics flying around. So for now we will probably have one meetup roughly every quarter, hopefully with lots of smaller talks, dojos, and more in the future! This can only work with a lot of help and talks by those that come to the meetups. So, our next event will be on January 08, 2025 at 18:30 again at [Spektral]([https://spektral.at](https://spektral.at/)) with some lightning talks, perhaps some experimenting, and Pizza ðŸ™‚

If this sounds like something for you (and perhaps you even want to present something), you can find more details and the signup link (optional but helps us with organizing the event) on <https://gograz.org/meetup/2025-01-08/>!
