title: 'Review: Learning GitHub Actions'
---

While I've already used GitHub Actions on various projects over the years I wanted to get a slightly broader overview and so picked up [Learning GitHub Actions](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-github-actions/9781098131067/) by [Brent Laster](https://github.com/brentlaster/). As the name somehow suggests, this book at first mostly is for people who have not worked with GHA before but also goes into quite a lot of detail that I wouldn't have expected!

It not only covers creating workflows and running them on GitHub-hosted runners but then describes things like creating your own actions and re-usable workflows. But my personal highlights where the chapters around monitoring your workflows and improving the security around them and your whole setup!

To summarise, I got out of this book exactly what I had hoped - and more! I think this book is just a great read. If you're considering GitHub Actions for your CI setup or have already used it for smaller setups, "Learning GitHub Actions" will definitely offer something for you!
