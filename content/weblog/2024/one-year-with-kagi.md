title: One year with Kagi
---

It's now been [a bit over year](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2023/10/21/trying-kagi-search-for-real/) that I've been using [Kagi](https://kagi.com) as my primary search engine and so I thought it might be a good time to do a quick review.

I'm torn since I'm still really happy with the search performance and also with the results compared to similar queries done on DuckDuckGo (which I have configured on some of my devices by default).

On the other hand I rarely if ever use the more advanced features like lenses and custom filters. That being said, it has turned out extremely helpful that I can influence the [ranking of certain domains](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/website-info-personalized-results.html) which just instantly makes default search results more useful. It's still 10 USD/month (+ taxes) which is still on the upper end of what I'm willing to spend.

So, I'm going to stay with Kagi for now and will try to use more or their features. I especially like their ["Quick Answer" feature](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/quick-answer.html) which you trigger by entering a proper question ending with a question mark into the search field. 

And, to end this with a feature request: I'd really like to see a lense similar to "Small Web" but focused on blogs. Theoretically, "Small Web" should come quite close here but for some reason it just doesn't. Please add a better blog and social-web focused search ðŸ˜€
