During a recent weekend trip to Frankfurt we went with a larger group to [Nakorn Thai](https://www.nakornthaifrankfurt.de). I don't often go to Thai restaurants and when I do I usually just eat Pad Thai. Not so this time! I had an awesome fruity curry (Gaeng Kua) with duck and it was delicious! I don't enjoy overly hot meals and so picked a mild one and it was just perfect. Most of the group has already been here before and went with fried noodles with red curry (Nakorn Thai Mae Mau) and also loved it.

Combined with the cozy atmosphere and extremely friendly and quick service it was just a great visit. We also considered going back the next day but the servings were just too large for two days in a row ðŸ˜„  When I get back to Frankfurt some time in the future, Nakorn Thai will be very high on my list!
