title: EURO 2024 is finally over
---

After exactly one month, the UEFA EURO 2024 is over. There were quite a few surprises during the group and tournament phases. I hadn't expected for the Austrian team to do as well as they did, reaching the top of their group but then being kicked out by T√ºrkiye in the round of 16. It was also great to see the spirit of the Georgian team which reached the same stage, too ‚ù§Ô∏è

On the other hand, I was really disappointed by the Belgian and English teams and the the Turkish fans, but especially that England made it all the way to the finals despite playing really badly up until the semi-finals. I was just glad that they met Spain in the finals and they lost. But other than those I really enjoyed the whole event. Most matches were good to great (with only the ones with England being really boring) and I managed to watch most of them. Due to the heat wave, though, I couldn't go to any public viewing sessions. Next time again üòÑ
