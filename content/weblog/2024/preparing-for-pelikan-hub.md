title: Preparing for my first Pelikan Hub
---

Whenever Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley on [The Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict) talk about "pen shows" and other stationery events I also want to go there one day. Unfortunately, this hasn't happened yet especially since I can hardly argue for travelling around the world for a pen show alone and as long as [The Pacific Northwest Pen Show](https://pnwpenshow.com/) and [WriteTheDocs Portland](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/) don't take place closer to each other, things will stay complicated.

Not a pen show but I thanks to some blogs I've stumbled upon [Pelikan Hubs](https://www.pelikan-hubs.com/) some months ago and decided to sign up for one. While there is no hub in Graz, there *will be* one in Vienna on September 27th!

Now ... if you've read any of my other posts about fountain pens, you will be hard pressed to find any mention of Pelikan. Well, I haven't written with a Pelikan for a long time but I really enjoy some of their inks. Still, it would be awkward to appear without anything. Luckily, I recently found one of my old school fountain pens: A [Pelikan L65](https://www.pelikan-collectibles.com/en/Pelikan/Models/Level-Series/index.html) (LeVel).

Back in the late 1990s I really loved that pen simply because I no longer had to deal with ink cartridges that could leak in my school bag. Instead, it was somehow like an eyedropper but you had to use a special ink bottle to fill it up. (Yes, I didn't know about piston fillers back then.) And, after a bit of cleaning, it still works! Unfortunately, I had purchases a broad nib back then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But I feel prepared now! üòÄ
