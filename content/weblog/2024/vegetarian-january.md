title: 'Vegetarian January: A quick summary'
---

So, while pretty much half of social media was doing either DryJanuary or Veganuary, I opted for a more light-weight "challenge": Going vegetarian for a month. Looks like there does not exist a widely accepted and social-media approved term but for that I think I'll just call it "Vegetanuary" ðŸ¤ª I mostly managed to stick a vegan dishes, too, but I simply didn't want to explicitly avoid milk. Over the years I've tried milk-replacement drinks again and again, but I simply don't like the taste for my morning cereals or a hot chocolate. Thanks to some really good vegan mayonnaise replacements, I *can* actually avoid eggs in a lot of situations, so perhaps something to aim for next year!

The one big downside of going vegan/vegetarian today for me is that (if you also want something beyond vegetables from the food market, are not the best cook, or simply don't have the time to pre-cook all the time) you have to deal with a lot of plastic packaging. If you're lucky then there is only one layer of packaging now. A couple of years ago you had to deal with an outer layer and then each item was packaged *again*. Luckily, this got better and some companies are also trying to use compostable/bio-degradable materials but I think we still have a long way to go here.

There was also a lot of trial an error involved with new products but I have to give one shoutout to the German sausage company [RÃ¼genwalder](https://www.ruegenwalder.de/de), which in my opinion produces excellent vegan spreads that taste remarkably close to their meat-based counterparts! I should probably avoid highly processed food like these but I'll make an exception for their products anytime ðŸ¤ª But again: Highly processed food is probably not something you should eat too much of...

On the plus-side, eating less meat over the last couple of years has improved my well-being by a lot! It takes a lot to get me feel completely stuffed after a meal (or even two!). It's, obviously, anecdotal but I like that approach, eating meat only when I have to chance to eat it at a very high quality level!
