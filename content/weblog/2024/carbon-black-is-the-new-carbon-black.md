title: Carbon Black is the new Carbon Black
---

I’ve been trying to use Platinum Carbon Black ink for the longest time in various fountain pens. I think the only one in my collection that never had it is my Lamy 2000, simply because I really don’t like taking that one completely apart.

A big problem that I’ve always had with it, though, is that it tends to clog up the nib pretty quickly. Especially in my Pilot Capless F, then ink is mostly useless. I have to scratch a bit to get it to write again every single morning. I love its darkness but this process has now finally pushed me over the edge and I’m now trying out other black, water resistant inks. So I went to my local fountain pen store and went out with two new inks: [Graf von Faber-Castell Carbon Black](https://shop.graf-von-faber-castell.us/products/ink-bottle-carbon-black-141000) and [Rohrer & Klinger Lotte](https://www.rohrer-klingner.de/en/sketchink-2/).

Of these two I’ve now had the Faber-Castell in my Capless for the last couple of days and I love it. In paper (Midori MD) it looks nearly identical to the Platinum ink but I don’t have to go through the daily ceremony anymore! At more than € 30 this is on the expensive side, but if it continues to perform like that, it will be a keeper!

That reminds me that I really need an ink swatch ring…
