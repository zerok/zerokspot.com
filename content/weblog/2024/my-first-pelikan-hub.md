title: My first Pelikan Hub
---

So the day has finally come and I attended my first pen event! Last Friday, right after work, I hopped onto a completely full train and went to Vienna for this yearâ€™s edition of the Pelikan Hub. At 18:00 the meet up started and shortly after that around 15 people filled up our table at [CafÃ© Benno]([https://www.cafebenno.at](https://www.cafebenno.at/)) with parts of their collection! 

I didnâ€™t have too much to contribute except for a new Nahvalur Eclipse that some wanted to give a try! I was definitely on the receiving end of knowledge here with lots of folks bringing not only their Pelikanâ€™s but also Esterbrooks, Sailors, and Graf von Faber Castells. I also had the chance to try a Lamy dialog cc. That one has been on my list for a long time but now Iâ€™m pretty sure that I actually want one.

While we all got the new [Pelikan Edelstein Gold Lapis](https://mam.pelikan.com/mam/de/pelikan/products/302234) (which is just beautiful btw.) (and a notepad) this was by far not the only ink to try out that evening! Some had tiny parts of their ink collections with them and everyone had some of their pens inked up! Iâ€™ve been struggling with Platinumâ€™s Carbon Black for a while now and thanks to some attendees Iâ€™m now eying various products by [Rohrer & Klinger](https://www.rohrer-klingner.de/en/en_home/). 

There was just too much to see and try. I had a wonderful evening and I hope to see everyone again at least next year or perhaps earlier at a different meetup! A big thank you to Victoria for doing all the organization around the event and carrying all those inks and other items around ðŸ˜ƒ
