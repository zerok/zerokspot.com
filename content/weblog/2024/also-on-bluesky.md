title: Yes, Iâ€™m also on Bluesky
---

OK, this is basically just another one of these posts that have been popping up left and right over the course of the last couple of weeks: Yes, [I am now also on Bluesky](http://bsky.app/profile/zerokspot.com) and I really like it!

Thatâ€™s the tl;dr version and now to some details: I really enjoyed my time on Twitter up until a couple of years ago when they started to lock down the API. Before that it was a place full of experiments. All of my little bubbles also somehow converged there and it was like the one place I could be a learn new things every minute. Backchannels for every conference? Check. Latest political developments? Check. Sci-Fi? You bet! While some of that also happened on Mastodon, it never felt the same.  Perhaps the sign-up process and fragmentation prevented some folks from joining, perhaps the account migration step meant that your posted needed to stay at your old place.

Because of all that I always kept an eye on Bluesky. Yes, itâ€™s not totally decentralized, I get that, but at the same time, there is just nothing like having access to a central or at least centrally aggregated stream of all things happening on the network; like with [Blueskyâ€™s firehose](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/firehose). Combined with their approach to moderation through labelling services, decentralized content storage, and feeds the network feels like one large playground right now. Itâ€™s awesome!

At the same time, the ecosystem is still very young. While the official iOS app is functional, working with feeds and timelines in general could be better. Iâ€™m mostly missing a way to save my scrolling position and ideally even sync it across devices but Iâ€™m pretty sure this will eventually be solved.

I also would like to integrate ATProto/Bluesky with this blog. So, Iâ€™ve started to basically reimplement [retoots](https://github.com/zerok/retoots). I also would love to eventually use my own PDS for storing my posts. Not yet sure about the timeline there, but hopefully soon ðŸ™‚
