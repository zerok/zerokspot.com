One of the highlights of our journey to Amsterdam was a trip to the [NDSM](https://www.ndsm.nl/en/), a district formerly dedicated to shipyards, docks, and warehouses and now full of alternative restaurants, art galleries, and office space in the north of the city. There we stumbled upon the [Straat Museum](https://straatmuseum.com/en). Opened just a couple of years ago the former warehouse is now dedicated to street art and graffiti.

Every piece of art has its own multi-meter-wide wall, taking up as much space as it needs, filling every wall of the building. Most of the time there is even a second level of artworks going up all the way to the roof of the warehouse. In one corner there is a huge wood construction acting as entrance but also offering a way to the second floor. That’s also where a really nice café is located offering a view over the whole exhibition.

In short: Straat Museum is awesome and if you visit Amsterdam, you should definitely go there! Just take the ferry from Centraal to NDSM!
