For about a year now the [cinema next to my apartment][cp] has offered
something called "[MX4D][4d]" which promises additional light effects,
scents, light water sprays, rocking chairs etc.. I was surprised to
learn, that MX4D wasn't an IMAX product but developed by
[MediaMation][mm]. Tickets for movies being shown in that one room
where they have MX4D are quite expensive at EUR 18.90 (!) not
including drinks and snacks. That's basically the price of a
just-released Bluray for a single ticket.

Due to that high price (and me not particularly liking 3D effects in
movies anyway) I've not been to any of these showings yet; until
yesterday. A couple of days ago, [Gemini Man][gm] with Will Smith was
released and a couple of friends and I thought it might be nice to
see. Due to time-constraints the only show available was the MX4D one
and so we decided to swallow that particular pill and give it a try.

## Gemini Man

First let me write a little bit about the movie, though. Will Smith
plays an aging black-ops assassin (in the movie they even use the
actors actual age (!)) for the DIA that all of a sudden is being
hunted by someone looking remarkably like himself but 25 years
younger. That's pretty much it. Outside of that detail the plot feels
extremely generic and predictable. That being said, the visuals and
action sequences are extremely well done, and the acting by everyone
but especially Will Smith is excellent. It's a nice action movie
without any particular depth or drama, yet very entertaining.

On a local radio station, Gemini Man received *7 out of 10 points*,
something that I can completely get behind. Without [Will Smith][ws]
and [Mary Elizabeth Winstead][mw] it would have been a completely
different story, though.


## MX4D

OK, and now on to the tech:

* The 3D was good, albeit only in the close-up scenes. In scenes where
  the focus object was far away or it was just a landscape scene the
  picture was extremely blurry.
* The sound was also good, but nothing more. Personally, I prefer the
  sound in IMAX rooms.
* In a handful of scenes certain scents were injected. Actually, that
  would put it to favorably. In 3 scenes the smells of an undefined
  alcoholic drink and flowers was injected. Both should have been
  pleasant in the contect of the respective scenes but were not.
* The shaking chairs were actually great! There are small shockers
  embedded into the seat and the back that are activated during combat
  scenes and add to the experience. During a motor bike chase the
  seats also leaned in the proper directions in order to emulate
  going around corners with the protagonist.
* There were also a couple of compressed air nozzles close to my legs
  and neck, which were activated in firefights, giving me the feeling
  of something missing my head just by a few centimeters.
  
In total, I liked the experience. In most situations it added a little
to the atmosphere. Out of all the effects, only the smells were really
bad and were far too distracting. 

Is all that worth additional ~ EUR 10? Definitely not! If you have the
chance (and like Will Smith movies), watch this movie in 3D,
though. There are some good 3D-moments in the movie.
