title: Finally a Plotter!
---

After thinking about getting one for the last two years (or so), I finally managed to pick up a [Plotter bible-size](https://plotterusa.com/collection-by-bible-leather-binders/#bible-leather-binder) two weeks ago. Since then I've tried to find the perfect spot where it might fit into my setup. Thanks to it being a ring-binder system, it is well suited to capturing ideas that might grow to cover more than one page. It also makes it easy to just take out pages that I no longer need (like really stupid ideas) to keep the whole binder lean.

As I said, I'm still looking for the perfect place for it, but these two use-cases have worked well over the last weeks and I think they will stick:

- Collecting ideas for blog posts with one idea per piece of paper. This way I can easily archive pages that already made it onto zerokspot.com or that I no longer consider pursuing. 
- In my bullet journal I had tons of lists like gift ideas for friends and family, or just places I'd eventually like to visit. These also fit well into this format since those lists can only really grow over time 😁

Once I have settled on a setup, I'm going to report back and also go into more detail about what was all part of the package I ordered and why 🙂
