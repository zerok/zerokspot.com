title: 'Netflix is on a roll: Dept. Q'

Somehow Netflix is currently on a roll! After watching and absolutely loving ‚ÄúThe Residence‚Äù we also watched [Dept. Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q) over the last weekend. It‚Äôs definitely not as different as a show about a bird-loving detective resolving a murder case in the White House but it was still extremely thrilling.

The 9 episodes are mostly your usual police department/crime thriller with a cranky detective and sidekicks working on a cold-case. So far so non-spectacular. Unlike many other crime shows, the plot actually contains tons of surprises and at least to me it wasn‚Äôt clear up until the last episode who the perpetrator was and how this thing was going to end! The main characters have a deep backstory and are all great, too. Usually, you have a couple of folks that are unlikable AND forgettable. That was not the case here! Even the competing detective that‚Äôs always annoyed by main protagonist because he‚Äôs just better at solving cases was not a throw-away character but you could see him suffering due to his role.

Of course it also helped that the show was taking place in Edinburgh which I just visited in April üôÇ The location automatically a bit of gloominess which you‚Äôd also get for crime shows from Denmark or Sweden. Since the [book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_Q) that show is based on originates in Denmark, moving the plot all the way to Scotland feels a bit weird but stand-alone it works!

Now I just hope there‚Äôs going to be a second case for Carl Morck, Akram Salim, and Rose Dickson!
