title: Another Spotify feature that I will not use
---

Iâ€™ve been using Spotify for a very long time. Over the years, though, it has become more and more filled with features that I donâ€™t care for or that I actively do not want to use. Podcasts are one example, audiobooks another and there is no way to hide them inside the app.

Now they are about to add another such feature: [direct messages](https://www.theverge.com/news/765771/spotify-messages-dms-audio-sharing-feature). It is one thing to allow users to build a network of friends and everyone recommending songs to each other, but a full-fledged direct messaging system? Not another communication channel please ðŸ˜© Canâ€™t I just pick a friend (or group of friends) and send them a song? Oh wait, I can already do that in normal messaging apps and I can also share global recommendations through playlists et al.

I think I can eventually give up on my wish to have a home screen in the app that actually shows me what I want without being filled with all those other features that I donâ€™t care about. Please just add a flag that I can set somewhere ðŸ™‚ Or are such features the main excuse for the recent price increase?
