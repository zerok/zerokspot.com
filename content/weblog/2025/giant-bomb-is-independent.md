title: Giant Bomb is now staff-owned!
---

For a long time Iâ€™ve been following gaming news quite intensively mostly through podcasts like the 1UP Show and later the Gianb Bombcast. Iâ€™ve been listening to the latter pretty much from day one but then life happened I didnâ€™t have enough time for gaming anymore. My best guess right now is that I stopped following the crew there around 2017 so I didnâ€™t even know that Jeff Gerstmann had left/been fired and Dan Ryckert returned.

Then last week the website was [in the news](https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet) again after their then-owners ,[Fandom, had announced](https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/official-giantbomb-staff-statement-on-livestream-p-1937031/) plans to restructure the site and a hiatus on streams and podcasts. There was a large outcry in the community and I think pretty much everyone was expecting the end of Giant Bomb as we knew it.

Everything changed last night, though! Fandom and the Giant Bomb crew [announced that the site would continue independently](https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/official-giantbomb-staff-statement-on-livestream-p-1937031/) and owned by the staff! I cannot describe how happy such news make me considering everything else going on in the world. There will also be a premium subscription for 9.99 USD per month or 99.99 USD per year which will directly feed into the site and the staff working on it. Thatâ€™s definitely more attractive than sending Fandom money ðŸ˜„
