title: Emojis and personality traits
---

Last year a [study](https://openresearch.okstate.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e53b35b3-6290-4f43-a636-5474c986fedd/content) was published around the usage of emojis in textual communication and personality traits. Unfortunately, I haven’t read the study paper as a whole but the analysis section and the summary provided by an article in the Austria newspaper [Der Standard](https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000268319/wer-haeufig-emojis-nutzt-koennte-eine-persoenlichkeitsstoerung-haben) were quite interesting despite being limited to 285 participants at (presumably) a single location.

Emojis seem to have heavily used to influence the outside image of a person, either related to narcissism for women or machiavellianism for men, if heavily used. Both kind of surprised me since I personally use emojis quite frequently (to the annoyance of some folks which tell me to just stop 🤣) but for other reasons.

My primary goal is to represent in a textual medium how I’d talk to the reader in-person, indicating with a ”😉”, for instance, that something was ment in jest; or with “🙂” that everything is good and can be solved. Does that to some degree influence the way others see me? I guess, but that’s not the goal here.

How are you using emojis? Does my use of them influence how you see me? Please let me know!
