title: Techo Kaigi for 2026
---

October is now long over, but, unfortunately, I had other things on my mind back then and so I couldn’t really think about my planner setup for 2026 until recently. A couple of things were mostly set, though:

- Journal: Here I’ll still use a Hobonichi Original. Somehow the bulletin list format for the most important events and thoughts of each day has worked well for me. One day I will find a good place for longer, private thought pieces, too.
- Personal tasks: These I’ll keep managing with OmniFocus. My load right now is still too high and diverse to work with something like a classic Bullet Journal. As much as I think about also moving personal items into my Plotter with that system, GTD is still the way to go for now.
- Travel journaling: In 2024 I got a full-size Traveler’s Notebook for that. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the capacity for them. To be fair, I also didn’t have any real vacation in 2025 but hopefully 2026 will offer more opportunities for travel journaling again!
- Work tasks: Ever since I got my [bible-sized Plotter](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2025/05/05/not-a-plotter-review/) this February I’ve been using it for managing my operational work tasks in a Bullet Journal-inspired system. This is still working well and I’ll keep using that.

Alongside work tasks I also use my Plotter as a commonplace book for things like movie lists and more. Short notes and inbox items (according to GTD) often end up in my passport size Traveler’s Notebook.

In January I might have the opportunity to also get my hands on some more Plotter products, so the setup described above might be temporary in a few areas. Let’s see 😂
