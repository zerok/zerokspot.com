title: Sometimes secret levels are also boring
---

I've seen lots of mentions of a show called ["Secret Level"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Level) on Amazon Prime. I didn't want to get spoiled so after I read that it's video-game related I basically stopped reading and watched the whole thing in a few sittings.

All 15 episodes are nicely animated, but if you compare them with "Love, Death & Robots" by the same creator, every episode doesn't feel that different from the other. There are some nice ideas, but most of the time the episodes left me uninterested in exploring their respective universe more. Some episodes have some special appearances like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the episode for "New World: Aeternum" but that's about it.

Out of these 15 episodes I only enjoyed two: "Exodus: Odyssey" and "Concord: Tale of the Implacable". The rest felt mostly empty or just too focused on violence for no actual point.  In the end, I just wish I had only watched these two episodes.
