title: "Pelikan Hub 2025 in Vienna"
---

It's been a while and a lot has happened in my life. Focusing on the positive I thought it might be nice to do a little recap of my trip to Vienna two weeks ago for this year's Pelikan Hub 🙂

This time the event took place in the [local Boesner store][bs]. For those who don't know, Boesner is a German chain for art supplies. Whenever someone I know needs something for drawing or painting, they go there, so it must be good 😉 In the store in Vienna there is also a nice café which kept open for us beyond the normal business hours.

In there we had pretty much all the tables available to us. While some folks came with huge collections of Pelikan pens, pretty much everyone also had fountain pens from a wide range of other makers, from large to small. Thanks to that I could finally try if a [Pilot Capless Decimo][decimo] really fit into my Plotter's pen holder. I guess, I really need to eventually get one 😅

Another eyecatcher was an orange [Diplomat Aero][aero]. It's beautiful but ... I just couldn't stop playing with the click of the cap. The gold one is just a bit outside my price range.

After a nice [Carinthian beer][km] and a lot of browsing, I had to say my good-byes. The day had been long and I wanted to get a lot of sleep before returning to Graz the next morning.

Huge thanks to Christa for doing the organisation this year and preparing all these beautiful gift packages that not only contained the latest "Ink of the year" but also some goodies from the Boesner store!
