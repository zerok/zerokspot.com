title: Donating blood
---

I donâ€™t know why but for some reason far too many years pass between me donating blood. It does not take any real effort nor more than an hour of my time. Since I also donâ€™t suffer from any side-effects there is really no reason why I shouldâ€™t donate more often. So after 8 years and a talk with a co-worker I thought it was finally time to go to the [Red Cross](https://www.roteskreuz.at/blut/home) again. As with my previous visits the process was just very streamlined and everyone exceedingly friendly. One thing Iâ€™ll do next time, though, is fill out the required health form online (either through the website or their dedicated app). This is probably the one thing that took the longest ðŸ˜„

Unfortunately the local app we have here in Styria feels a bit buggy but itâ€™s still useful if for nothing else than acting as a donor pass and showing when would be my next possible date. I should probably come up with a schedule for a recurring event in my calendar that Iâ€™m only allowed to skip if Iâ€™d not be allowed to donate anywhere or if Iâ€™m on vacation ðŸ˜¬
