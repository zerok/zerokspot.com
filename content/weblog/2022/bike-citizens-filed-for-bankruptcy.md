A couple of days [the news came in](https://steiermark.orf.at/stories/3183136/) that the company behind the app [Bike Citizens](https://www.bikecitizens.net) (originating in Graz) and various other utilities around biking is broke. According to [this article on Brutkasten](https://brutkasten.com/bike-citizens-grazer-fahrrad-startup-schlittert-in-konkurs/) while the filing for bankruptcy mentions no planned business continuation, there might still be a chance as there are talks going on with some potential investors.

In case youâ€™ve never heard of this app, itâ€™s basically a map application optimized for bicycle riders where you can, for instance, configure that you have an e-bike and can therefore better deal with slight inclines. Combined with the smartphone mount [Finn](https://getfinn.com/) this offers a nice package!

Sadly, the app doesnâ€™t offer all that many useful features beyond the core routing and even multi-point routing is locked behind a subscription. Combined with some recent server stability issues I had somehow already gotten the impression that something might be going on here. Keeping servers maintained over the weekends usually isnâ€™t that hard with a bit of redundancy and on-call employees. If thereâ€™s no money for even that...

Too bad, I really liked the idea behind the app and Bike Citizens as a whole. If they manage to survive this, I hope there will be some money for a slightly more feature-rich application ðŸ™‚
