Last week Iâ€™ve been to Paris for the first time in a couple of years. While there Iâ€™ve noticed that some of the places I really enjoyed had less than stellar ratings on Google Maps and other places. To change that Iâ€™ve started to post some reviews there and also mirror them here. At this point Iâ€™m not yet sure how many posts these are going to be but here it goes ðŸ™‚

[Le CafÃ© Qui Parle](https://cafequiparle.fr) is a tiny cafÃ© in Montmatre with a small but quite versatile menu. This time we were there in a group of four and had the escargots de Bourgogne (snails with lots of garlic!), raviole de Royan a l'huile de truffle (ravioli with cheese and truffle oil) and the soupe a l'oignon (onion soup) as starters. For the main course we took again the raviole with truffle, tartare de boeuf (beef tartare), and the "La belle salad de chevre chaud" (basically salad with lots of cheese and honey etc.). While I personally don't like truffles, the others told me that the ravioli were excellent, as were the snails, the soup, and the cheese salad! Especially the latter was just huge and looked stunning! As for the beef tartare: This was actually one of the reasons why we went there again after having visited in 2017. It was perfect, served with roasted potatoes.

The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful despite our large knowledge gaps regarding the French language. As for the furniture and style, it's exactly what you'd expect in a French cafÃ© and everything including the toilet was tidy and clean ðŸ™‚

I think Le CafÃ© Qui Parse might be the one restaurant in Paris that will always be on my list when in town!
