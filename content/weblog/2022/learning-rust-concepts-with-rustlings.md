Every now and then Iâ€™m trying to learn Rust. For some reason it hasnâ€™t clicked with me yet though but at least this time Iâ€™ve tried something new: Normally I use Exercism for getting used to a new language or just exploring it. But with Rust in particular I think my main problem is that I donâ€™t know what Rust code should look like and how all these concepts are actually used in practice. For this reason Iâ€™ve done all the nearly 100 exercises that the [Rustlings project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) offers over the last two weeks ðŸ™‚

Unlike [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) where you get a task and need to implement it as idiomatically as possible, Rustlings provides you incomplete code and tasks you to finish/fix it using a specific language concept that it wants to teach you in each exercise. This starts with how to work with the two string types all the way up to multi-threading, reference counting, and queues. Obviously, also borrowing got its set of exercises and that concept might finally have clicked with me. Life-times were also quite close but Iâ€™m not ready for them yet ðŸ™ƒ

Even *if* this doesnâ€™t manage to really get me into Rust (and the final decision hasnâ€™t been made yet) I had lots of fun here and can absolutely recommend it to anyone who is event remotely interested in Rust!
