I usually only write about fountain pens here but a couple of weeks ago I saw on one of the more [recent GCP Grey videos](https://youtu.be/fSwpe8r50_o) a rollerball pen that looked really nice, simple, and had an awesome click-sounds. After a bit of research I learnt it’s called the [Mark One by Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone) in Austin, Texas.

After a bit of consideration I decided I wanted it. Sadly, the pen is only shipped from the UK if you’re living in Europe and so it took a bit of waiting for it to [make it through customs](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2022/02/04/tracking-parcels-is-hard/) and then arrive in Graz.

After a week I have to say, that the pen is exactly what I’ve been looking for in a rollerball pen. It feels great and weighty in my hand and the click-sound and feeling is just great. It doesn’t have a clip and is round so it *will* roll around on your table if you let it, though. What I’m not sure about yet, though, is if I like the Schmidt P8126 refill that comes with the pen. When it writes it’s fluid and great, but, sadly, there are quite a few situations where the gel flow isn’t great and so results in not uniform line thickness. It might also be that I just hold it slightly wrong then but I’ll definitely try to find other gel refills.
