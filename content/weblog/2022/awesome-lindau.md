Since Iâ€™ve now been multiple times to Lindau I thought it would be time to create a little collection of places Iâ€™ve enjoyed there. This is meant as a living listing so unlike other posts this *will* be updated over time. The items in here are sorted in no particular order. If possible, Iâ€™ll also write dedicated reviews to all of them but this will take time and so, for now, this is primarily a list pointing to the official website of each location or at least a map position ðŸ˜‰
