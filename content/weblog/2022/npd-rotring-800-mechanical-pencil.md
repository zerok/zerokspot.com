It’s been a while but this Wednesday was finally a “new pen day” (NPD) again! I’ve grown scared of putting my trusted Kuru Toga pencil directly into my backpack and also tired of carrying an extra pencil-case with me all the time. For this reason I started looking around for mechanical pencils that had a way to retract the lead.

After reading about the new [Kuru Toga Dive](https://www.mpuni.co.jp/special/kurutogadive/) I absolutely wanted to have one. Two months later with no information if it will ever actually reach Europe I’ve chosen plan-B: A [rOtring 800](https://www.rotring.com/pens-pencils/pencils/rotring-800/SAP_1904447.html). This one has an extremely sleek design with some nice golden elements and - “drum-roll” - a retraction mechanism that looks and feels quite solid! And yes: I already miss the auto-sharpening system that makes the Kuru Togas so special but I can live with having to manually rotate my pencil every now and then 😅

After a day of usage it feels great. So far I also haven’t noticed the wobble that many other folks complained about. The Kuru Toga had much more on that front… ok, at only a fraction of the price 🙃 So: 👍👍 for now!
