Last weekend I’ve been to my first concert in a long time! Back in 2019 I had gifted my partner tickets to the City of Sound event in Graz with [Seeed](https://www.seeed.de/) and Fettes Brot. Then Corona came and that event got moved from summer of 2020 to 2021 and from Graz to Vienna, Krieau. To actually nobody’s surprise Corona was still a topic in 2021 and so the event was moved again by a year to 2022 and from Krieau to [Stadthalle](https://www.stadthalle.com/en). 

So, with a delay of 2 years, [last weekend](https://www.stadthalle.com/en/schauen/events/1143/SEEED) was finally our chance to see Seeed live and they were awesome! Fettes Brot was no longer part of the line-up but now we heard [Fritz Kalkbrenner](https://fritzkalkbrenner.com/). That mix worked out amazingly! Kalkbrenner warmed up the crowd with great dance beats and Seeed then continued with some of their old and new hits all in a non-stop medley.

What pleasantly surprised me that the live performance was much more rock & drum’n base’y than their studio tracks which are mostly reggae & dancehall sounds. Honestly, I haven’t enjoyed a live performance so much before!
