Due to limited availability Dorian and I have decided to let [GoGraz](https://gograz.org) have a little break over the summer months. This means that there wonâ€™t be any meetups in July and August but we hope to see each other again on [Sept 19](https://meetu.ps/e/.twfzrsydcmbzb/5hc24/i), refreshed and with some talks!

And since due to the thunderstorm last Monday I even have an intro to OpenPolicyAgent in a nearly-ready state ðŸ˜¬
