Just a couple of weeks after 2021 we now know the date and place for this year‚Äôs edition of [GopherCon US](https://gophercon.com): It will take place between September 25 and September 28 in [The Walt Disney World Dolphin Resort](https://www.disneyworld.eu/resorts/dolphin-hotel/) in Florida. I guess the first two days will again be full of workshops while the talks will take place on September 27 and 28. I hope there‚Äôs also going to be a coding sprint/hackathon either before or after the main event.

For now, there is already a [call-for-papers](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon-2022) going on on PaperCall until March 6! The early bird sale has also already started with tickets being available for US$ 695.

I cannot tell you how much I‚Äôd like to attend this event! GopherCon plus Disney World just sounds too good! Flying to Florida for only two days is a bit much. If I decide to do that, I‚Äôll probably pad it with some other activities. This sounds like a good opportunity for some beach holiday üòÅ
