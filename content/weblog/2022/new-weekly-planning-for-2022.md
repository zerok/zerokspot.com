For the last couple of weeks of 2021 I was thinking really hard about getting a [Hobonichi Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/) for the new year. I would like to not only organize tasks but also keep more detailed daily schedules in my journal. In the end I decided against the Techo, though, as I feared it would be too strict and rigid. For this reason I’m going now with an additional timeline that I’ve added to the layout [u/tinyconversation0 posted in 2020 on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bujo/comments/g3z8vx/it_took_a_while_to_figure_out_a_weekly_spread/) and that I’ve [been using off and on](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/06/17/simplified-daily-weekly-planning/) since then.

That timeline is placed directly between the daily columns so that I only have to draw it once for two days. On each side of that timeline I then have 1 cm of space for adding events or time ranges. Not a lot of real-estate but quite practical with a pencil.

In addition to that I’m now also creating my weekly double-spreads no longer for just a week in advance but at least a month if not more. I’m now nearly done with my current journal and perhaps I will even prepare these spreads for a quarter or even six months.
