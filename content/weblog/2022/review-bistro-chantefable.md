On our last evening we wanted to end it we wanted to have some duck steak! Since Le Petit Canard is now closed, we had to look for a new place. The [Bistro Chantefable](http://chantefable.fr/en/home/) had a great duck and much more including delicious oysters in various price levels and snails.

The bistro itself was exactly that: a classic and classy bistro with very attentive staff. If I wanted to find one thing to criticize it would be that the sauce that was served with the duck was too intense and masked the tasty duck meat itself. Everything else was perfect, though, and I'm already looking forward to my next dinner there ðŸ˜Š
