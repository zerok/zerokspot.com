[FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/) is just three weeks away and since today [FosdemToGo](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/fosdemtogo/id1500192366?l=en) can also show you this yearâ€™s schedule. I originally wanted to finally automate the check if a schedule is available and unlock it in the app, but I didnâ€™t get to it in time. Perhaps next year ðŸ™ƒ

Anyway, this is the only change with the latest release. I hope that I will find the time for improving the app this year and even move it to SwiftUI. Letâ€™s see ðŸ˜Š If you want to give FosdemToGo a try, you can find it in the [iOS AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/fosdemtogo/id1500192366?l=en) ðŸ™‚

I hope to see you all in the FOSDEM Matrix rooms on Feb 5 and Feb 6!
