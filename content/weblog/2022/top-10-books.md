This morning [Hyde asked around, if there were only 10 books, which ones would you take with you](https://lazybear.io/notes/top-10-books/)? At first I could only [come up with 7](https://chaos.social/@zerok/108219585643163283) but I intended to complete that list eventually. So here would be my list of 10 books in no particular order. Please note that this also includes some audio-books simply because they are superior to the text-editions due to the voice acting talent of the narrator.
