The summer break is over and [GoGraz](https://gograz.org/) is back! For [this month‚Äôs meetup](https://gograz.org/meetup/2022-09-19/) we had originally planned to just do a small in-person meeting at Lendplatz but it turned out too cold; dry but simply too cold! Since it was not yet time for mulled wine we opted for a nice table in the basement of the nearby restaurant [Scherbe](https://www.scherbe.com/).

While the acoustics weren‚Äôt the best (ok, they were pretty bad actually) I gave a brief introduction into [OpenPolicyAgent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) and how you can use it to define and act upon policies for various systems. It was mostly improvised as I obviously didn‚Äôt have projector at hand but I hope I got at least some of the benefits of the system across. If you want to take a look at what I‚Äôve presented on Monday, you can find the repository including a demo implementation, some Markdown ‚Äúslides‚Äù and more on [zerok/gograz-presentations-opa on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/zerok/gograz-presentations-opa).

We also had a few new faces which led to some great discussions around the unique characteristics of Go and possible integration paths with other environments as it‚Äôs done, for instance, using [cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) by the [wails project](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails). Also a couple of learning avenues were mentioned like the good-old [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/) and I also expressed my wish that there should be something like [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) but for Go üòÖ

As an organiser my primary take-away from Monday is that I should definitely invest more time in planning for various weather scenarios. I had somehow hoped that ‚Äúnot raining‚Äù would also mean ‚Äúwarm enough‚Äù but that was wrong that late in the year. I‚Äôm not yet sure how we will handle in-person events in the future but except for some mulled wine-themed meetup, it will have to be either in a restaurant with a proper table reservation or a meeting room at a co-working space (or something similar). 

For those of you who came on Monday, I want to thank you very much and once again apologise for the ‚Äúcontrolled amount‚Äù of chaos in our organisation üòÖ
