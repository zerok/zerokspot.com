While traveling a lot via train this weekend, I finally had the chance to finish [Netflix's adaptation of *Cowboy Bebop*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop_(2021_TV_series)). Took me long enough but that was definitely not due to the quality of the show. 

It was not a perfect show but, in my opinion, a really good one that managed to convey quite a lot of the original’s spirit. In 10 episodes covered quite a lot of the main story points from the relationship between Spike and Vicious and IMO even does a better job here than the anime. That whole conflict is actually the primary focus here with things like what happened to Earth and other historical backgrounds are at best hinted at.

Given the last minutes of the first season I guess these aspects were planned for a second season. Now we’ll never know 😞 What we got with season one, though, was great acting by John Cho as Spike, Mustafa Shakir as Jet, and Daniella Pineda as Faye. There was also a glimpse at some ship combat with Spike’s and Faye’s little fighters and Mad Pierrot and Ein 😍 I really wish that Netflix hadn’t chancelled the show...
