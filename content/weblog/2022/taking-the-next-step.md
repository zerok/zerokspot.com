After 13 years I’ve now decided to try something new and am therefore leaving [Netconomy](https://netconomy.net/) with the end of November. Over the years I’ve worked on large-scale e-commerce platforms, mobile applications, infrastructure projects, and much more. I’ve also had the chance to work with lots of awesome people, many of which I’ve the privilege of calling friends now. Without Netconomy I wouldn’t be where I am today and I’d like to wish everyone there all the best for the future!

I’ve looked long and hard of where I’d like to work next. One absolute requirement was that I’d like to work on or supporting a product that I’m enjoying to use myself. While browsing the various platforms I stumbled upon an opening at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/) and decided to just give it a try. I’ve used many of their products in the past, from the original Grafana dashboard solution to Loki and Tempo and simply love the vision behind them and also the [“big tent” philosophy](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/04/04/welcome-to-grafanas-big-tent-a-podcast-about-people-community-tech-and-tools-around-observability/) of the company.

Starting with December I’ll have the privilege of working in the release team there. I cannot describe how excited I am and looking forward to great new challenges 😃
