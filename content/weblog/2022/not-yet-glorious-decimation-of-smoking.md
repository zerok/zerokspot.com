Triggered by [this post by Matt Birchler](https://birchtree.me/blog/the-glorious-decimation-of-smoking/) were he mentioned that in the US only about 12.5% of adults were still smoking, I went looking for some statistics for Austria. Turns out [Statistik Austria also has some numbers](https://statistik.at/statistiken/bevoelkerung-und-soziales/gesundheit/gesundheitsverhalten/rauchen) going back to 1972!

|Year | Men | Women |
|-|-|-|
| 2019 | 23.7% | 17.9% |
| 2014 | 26.7% | 22.2% |
| 2006 | 27.5% | 19.2% |
| 1972 | 38.7% | 9.8% |

While smoking is on the decline at least for men, the number of women smoking has only reached its peak in 2014. The range is a bit different from the US numbers, though, as people 16 years or older have been considered here.

With 20.1% in 2019 we are slightly higher than the [EU average](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/hlth_ehis_sk3e/default/table?lang=en) of 18.4 and it will probably take us a long time to reach the levellevel of Sweden (6.4%) if ever? ðŸ˜” That being said, at least since 2019 there has now been a [ban of smoking in restaurants](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/themen/gesundheit_und_notfaelle/rauchverbote___nichtraucherinnenschutz.html). No separated areas that simply never worked, no pure smoker or non-smoker restaurants. One rule for everyone. This took us long enough and there has been a lot of weird lobbying around that issue but in the end banning smoking in restaurants had finally been achieved.

Thinking back just about 10-15 years tourists from Austria were still surprised and some even angered by new rules having been put in place in Italy where indoor-smoking had just being banned. How times change and sometimes even for the better ðŸ˜€
