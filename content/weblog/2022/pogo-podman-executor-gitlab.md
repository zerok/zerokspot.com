Last Monday, [Christoph Lipautz](https://twitter.com/lipdaguit) presented a custom GitLab Runner [executer](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/) that is using [podman](https://podman.io/) under the hood at our [monthly Go meetup in Graz](https://gograz.org/meetup/2022-03-21/): [Pogo](https://github.com/eyeson-team/pogo). The executor is the component in the GitLab CI system that actually runs jobs passed to it. For that it handles 4 life-cycle steps: (1) config, (2) prepare, (3) run, and finally (4) cleanup . The runner provided by GitLab for use in your own environment comes with the following executors:

- SSH
- Shell
- VirtualBox
- Parallels
- Docker
- Kubernetes

If you want to have something different, then you have to hook a so-called custom executor which is what Pogo now provides. In general, the solution provides pretty much the same level of abstraction as the Docker executor but does not require a service running as root. Especially for on-premise systems this might be quite interesting and you cannot simply provision and de-provision machines that easily but also donâ€™t have to fear a job somehow gaining root access due to an issue within Docker.

Another nice feature of Pogo is that you can define custom volumes that should be mounted into the jobâ€™s execution environment depending on what tags are set for the job. Letâ€™s say that you have a job tagged with `data-media` then you could automatically mount a `media` folder into the job using the following configuration of the executor itself:

```yaml
mounts:
  - volume: "/mount/shared-media:/mount/media"
    tags:
      - "data-media"
```

Iâ€™ve been thinking again and again about moving my repositories off of GitHub and over to GitLab again. When (not if) I finally decided to do that and once again use my own runners, then Iâ€™ll definitely take a look at Pogo! But first I should probably finally spend some time with podman, nerdctl and all the other non-Docker container stuff that is available on Linux ðŸ˜…
