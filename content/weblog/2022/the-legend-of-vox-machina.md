I usually don‚Äôt enjoy fantasy but after a friend recommended [‚ÄúThe Legend of Vox Machina‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Vox_Machina) to me, I got curious. The show comes out of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign of the [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/) web-series, which is basically a group of  voice actors who like to play RPGs and broadcast it via Twitch and YouTube. The show was initially funded via Kickstarter and then picked up by Amazon.

The story of the first season on Amazon Prime follows the seven members of a group of mercenaries consisting of elves, gnomes, a human, and a barbarian that call themselves ‚ÄúVox Machina‚Äù. The group isn‚Äôt really successful at what they‚Äôre doing and so they are basically constantly out of money while primarily hanging out at taverns, drinking, with the exception of the group‚Äôs gnome bard who prefers flirting (and more) with pretty much any female being he comes across. In this first season, the group (after fighting a dragon) goes on a quest to avenge the he murder of the rulers of the town of Whitestone  from which one of their members originated. 

The whole show has a very sarcastic and funny tone, which was exactly what I need when I started watching it. It‚Äôs also very nicely animated and, since everyone on the cast *is* a profession voice actor, the voice acting is great. In the end I was actually quite sad that the season ended but a second season has already been confirmed üòç
