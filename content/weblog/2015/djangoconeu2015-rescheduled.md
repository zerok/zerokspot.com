title: DjangoCon Europe 2015 Rescheduled
---


This is probably the weirdest thing I've ever seen regarding pre-conference
organising. On January 1 the organisers of [DjangoCon Europe 2015][7]
[opened the registration process][2] for the "minority-only audience" (great
idea btw.. Let's see if it works as anticipated).

Then on January 8 [the news came][2] that there was a problem with finding
accommodation for the conference attendees due to the UK band "One Direction"
having [scheduled][4] two of their concerts in the UK in Cardiff right in the
middle of the conference (June 5 and 6) which resulted in fans flooding the city
and its hotels. A couple of days before the news broke I tried to get a room and
already back then it was starting to get hard to find a place for the night from
June 6 to June 7.

So the organisers had not much of a choice but to try to find a new time window
for the conference... which they did within 24 hours. On January 9 a
[new schedule][3] for the conference that would move the whole event up by a
couple of days. It now takes place from the 31st of May until the 5th of
June. Big kudos to the orga-team and their partners to be able to reschedule
the event that quickly while only changing the dates only so slightly. For what
it's worth, I didn't have to change my planning for the trip that much :-)

That whole situation was really strange, though, especially when news-outlets
like [The Register][5] and, of all places, [Polygon][6] started to pick up the
story. I guess, someone could have had one or two good friends in the
news-business :-)

Anyway, I really hope that the schedule is not changed anymore because now I
have a room reservation and am really looking forward to the event!
