title: This was DjangoCon Europe 2015
---


[DjangoCon Europe][de] is special. Most conferences I attend each year are
basically just that: Conferences, meet-ups of like-minded people discussing
interesting stuff. But what happened this past week in Cardiff is more like a
huge family gatherings but where you can talk tech with anyone 😀

And this year the organisers tried to make this family much bigger by explicitly
inviting new speakers to the event and helping them to get started. But not only
speakers: There was also a whole day prior to the actual conference with
workshops and talks that were free to attend hosted by Cardiff University in the
same rooms as last year's DjangoWeekend. No registration required, to strings
attached. And from what I could see, quite a few people gave Django a shot there
😊

------

[Markus][mz] had a workshop scheduled on that day for people already familiar
with Python to learn the basics of Django. According to the sign-up page he
could expect around 20 attendees so he asked around if someone was willing to
help out. In the end we were about half a dozen trainers helping ... half a
dozen students. Slight overkill there on our end but still an awesome experience
for me as I had never done something like that before. If time permits I
definitely want to help with workshops again in the future 😁

Then came the conference days and with them some awesome talks by old and new
speakers. But the really interesting stuff happened between the talks (and I
don't mean the delicious Welsh Cakes 😉). There was, for instance, and impromptu
meeting of people interested in working on code-for-all-like projects in the
park in front of the City Hall (the location of the main conference part). We
didn't get that far there but there is now at least a [mailing-list][djso] where
we can stay in touch. It is open to the public, so if you're into this topic,
join!

IIRC that topic came up after the organisers announced that there would be
anonymous wellbeing sessions with [professionals][wb] from Cardiff University
being held alongside the conference. That institute was currently struggling
with some software issues so a couple of us gathered to help them as much as we
could. During the sprints we also started to work on a prototype for a system
that might facilitate some of their work-flows in the future.

If this still sounds too classic-conferencey for you, how about that:

* On the last sprint day we sang Happy Birthday to one of the workshop tutors
  after walking through half the university in order to make a surprise
  entrance.

* Daniele receives a book and a CD about/of his probably favorite boy-band by
  that time as a thank-you gift.

* There was a quiet-room for when you want to be left alone to cool down a bit.

* People talked very openly about whatever problems they had, not limited to
  technical but also social and psychological ones.

* The whole event was supposed to be as waste-free as possible, so there were no
  plastic cups or plates but every attendee received a
  [Klean Kanteen bottle][kk] and there were water coolers everywhere.

This year's event also tried to offer as many evening activities as
possible with one conference dinner for all held at the National Museum of
Cardiff and visits to [The Clink][tc] and the [Vegetarian Food Studio][vfs]. On
Thursday there was also a BBQ!

As mentioned above, there were also (as always) sprints going on after the
session-days. Due to my travel-plans I could only attend the first one but
managed to get a ton of stuff done there again including some fixes for
[django-backup][db]!

Aside from the conference I also did a bit of sight-seeing but I will try to put
that into some other posts either here or on my [travelogue][tl], so stay tuned 😉

There is not all that much left to say here other than a big THANK YOU to all
the organisers, volunteers, speakers and sponsors who made this event possible
and I can't wait for next year's DjangoCon Europe in Budapest 😃
