I had originally learnt about this book when Angus Crol gave a talk at dotJS
2014 in Paris. Sadly, it took me nearly two more years to finally also read it.

The book is quite a funny way to look at all the ways certain coding problems in
JavaScript may be solved if only we were famous authors. That being said, even
at 192 pages it felt a bit too long for me but I greatly enjoyed the
introduction of the various authors and the review of "their" solutions.
