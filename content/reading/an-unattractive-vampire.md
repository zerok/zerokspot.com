Haven't read a vampire story in a long time and after listening to the interview
on Sword & Laser with the author
[at the end of March](http://swordandlaser.com/home/2016/3/22/sl-podcast-248-the-truth-about-vampires)
I suspected this would be something for me 😉 It also helps that I could get this
book again DRM-free on
[Inkshares](https://www.inkshares.com/books/an-unattractive-vampire-4284)!
