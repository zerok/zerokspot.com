I love Torchwood and Doctor Who but for some reason have never tried one of the
novels in that universe before. That is now over ðŸ˜‰ Published in 2007, *Another
Life* is the first novel about the Torchwood 3 crew and plays probably somewhere
during the first season of the show. Curious if it will be as entertaining as
the show!

Sadly, it wasn't. While the characters match their TV-counterparts quite well,
the plot never goes beyond the OK-line and more often than not is just
poor. Some parts are OK while others have the characters do things that range
from wild-guesses to not even remotely plausible. I love Cardiff and all the
references to various locations there but, sadly, not even that helps much.


## Terms, objects, characters

- **A&E**: Owen refers to an A&E training he once had, which stands for
  "Accident and Emergency" and is the emergency unit in a hospital.
- **Brummie**: The term Gwen used to refer to the SOCO from Birmhimgham at the
  Fallon crime scene most likely references the [Birmingham Brummies][], a local
  speedway team.
- **Gower** is a peninsula in South Wales near Swansea.
- **[Rhondda][]** is a valley in Wales that was home to mining operatings.
- **SOCO**: Scene of Crime Officer of the British
  police. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_of_Crime_Officer) has
  more details.
- **SHO** or Senior House Officer is a role or rank of a doctor at a
  hospital. This rank has been replaced around 2005 but is still sometimes used
  inofficially. Curious, given that this book was published in 2007.

## Summary (SPOILERS)

An [Bruydac][] battle cruiser is sucked into the Rift from to other side and
gets stuck which causes the whole Cardiff area to destablize which causes the
weather to go crazy.

A group of friends (two soldiers and one researcher from Blaidd Drwg) discover
the alien ship on a diving tour and are captured. Since all crew members but one
are dead, the surivor implants remote-control devices into his victims in order
to find parts to repair the ship. Too bad, the pilot is addicted to human
spine-fluid and he in the body of his victims goes on a Vampire-style
murder-spree.

In the meantime Owen and Tosh experiment with a Second Life-style online game
where Owen meets his former girlfriend from London and tries to recruit her to
Torchwood.

In the end, she as well as the three divers and the alien are all killed (by
Jack or each other) and the ship is moved back into the Rift where it most
likely got ripped apart.
