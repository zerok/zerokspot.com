It's quite rare that I read a comic book but this collection of strips by
[Sarah Andersen](http://sarahcandersen.com/) I simply had to have. Too many of
these are simple things that I can absolutely relate to, like how awkward
interactions with other people are sometimes are or how easy it is to
procrastinate while important stuff (at least to other folks) is rescheduled ðŸ˜‰

With only ~100 pages it was perhaps a bit on the short side but there is so many
funny little stories in there, I will definitely come back to it time and time
again!
