Remember all these poor folks in the original Star Trek series wearing red
shirts and getting killed off like flies? Just imagine what would have happened
if they'd known about their situation and started to fight back.

The book started of quite promising with the lifes the crew of the Universal
Union's starship Intrepid dying left and right and their replacement finding out
that someting most be horribly wrong here. There is time-travel, there are wild
animals, everything that should make this a great read. Sadly, it's nowhere near
the depth of the author's other work in the *Old Man's War* series.

In the end I'm happy that I've red this one but it is hard to recommend to
anyone that doesn't know the original Star Trek show.
