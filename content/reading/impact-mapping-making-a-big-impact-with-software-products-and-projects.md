Recently (March 2016) while scanning my to-read list on Pocket I stumbled upon
an [article by Kevin Albert][ka] about Impact Mapping, a technique for making
sure that what you're working on actually makes sense in the big
picture. Imagine my surprise when, while moving from one office to another, I
found [the book][tb] mentioned in this article on a desk. Two days later I had
borrowed it ðŸ˜‰

Impact mapping is roadmap/project planning technique based around specifically
structured mindmaps. The focus here is on what should be achieved (the big goal,
or *the big WHY*), who contributes to achieving or preventing it (*actors*),
what would the actor do to affect the goal (*impact*), and how can the product
influence that impact with a *deliverable*. The author combines this with other
tools like data-based decision making to facilitate goal-tracking.

In this book you learn what a good impact map should look like, how to get there
(planning sessions, mapping sessions) and how to work with the result. The basic
idea is that impact maps help finding small deliverables that can be worked on
iteratively to achieve their big-picture goal.

Everything is presented in a very lighthearted but still extremely focused
way. The method sounds extremely useful and practical, so I'm pretty sure I will
eventually use it somewhere ðŸ˜Š
