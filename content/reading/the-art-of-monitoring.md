This book gives a nice introduction into various monitoring and alerting
techniques that should be generally applicable. Sadly, the author focuses on
Riemann perhaps a bit too much and in general goes into too much detail on how
to configure it. This way the book ended up being about 720 pages long with lots
of repeated (and partially redundant) information inviting to just skimming
instead of reading.
