Completely missed that Cory Doctorow has a [new book on the horizon](https://craphound.com/littlebrother/2020/04/28/a-new-marcus-yallow-little-brother-story/), scheduled to be released on 12 October. The third instalment of the "Little Brother" also is not YA:

> It’s a book about rationalization and redemption: how good people talk themselves into doing bad things, and what it takes to bring them back from the brink. I’m incredibly proud of it.

I should really find the time to read the first two books of the series before that, despite them being YA 😅
