The local Media Markt right now has a pre-order list where you pay €300 upfront and then get a bundle including Horizon Forbidden West and Gran Turismo 7 for €658 *this month*! I thought for not even a second and just pre-ordered it! This is still a bit of a premium price since I could get both games cheaper right now (and I actually don't care about GT7) but I'm just too happy that my long wait might eventually be over in 2-3 weeks 😍

I guess I should now finalise the list of stuff I want to get right away with my shiny new PS5 🤪
