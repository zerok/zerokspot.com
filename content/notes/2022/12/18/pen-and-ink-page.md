[Eivind Hjertnes](https://blog.hjertnes.website/) has now a [page](https://stationery.pizza/pen-inks) on [Stationery.Pizza](https://stationery.pizza) where he lists all the pens and inks he's currently using. I've wanted to do something similar for a really long time but couldn't yet decide if I wanted to be integrated with [FountainpenCompanion.com](https://www.fountainpencompanion.com/) or not ðŸ¤ª

I guess I should just do the static approach first and iterate if necessary...
