While on a little bike tour from Lindau to Friedrichshafen in order visit the Zeppelin Museum there I finally also listened to the Changelog episode from 2022-05-06 with Woody Zuill about mob programming, ensemble programming... whatever you want to call it. This interview is IMO a great introduction as it goes quite deep into the benefits but also shows that it is not meant as "the only tool" you should use. I also particularly enjoyed the segment about introducing the method to a team using coding dojos!
