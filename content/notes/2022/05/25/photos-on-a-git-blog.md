This is exactly what I'm currently struggling with. Since my whole blog is stored inside a Git repository I don't want to store large photos there. I'm working on a solution for that but will need a bit more time. Once that's in place I will post lots of photos here üòÅ

It's basically an API that I can then simply use with shortcuts from my phone or laptop and that will resize the photos as needed. I just need one or two more train rides to finish the minimal implementation üôÉ
