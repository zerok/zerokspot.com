One thing that absolutely fascinated me about the [Zeppelin Museum](https://www.zeppelin-museum.de/) in Friedrichshafen is that they have rebuilt a large part of the passenger area of the airship [LZ 129 Hindenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_129_Hindenburg)!

In the picture above you can see the lounge and behind the wall at the end of the room is a "writing room" complete with postbox. Turns out that they had their own postal service on the airship which put special stamps on letters there.
