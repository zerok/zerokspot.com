Thanks to [this discussion on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/upehq2/shoutout_to_penstorecom_eu_who_not_only_checked/) I now know another online shop in the EU specialized on pens: [PenStore.com](https://penstore.com/) from Sweden. While they don't have fountain pen under the sun (unlike Akkerman), they have quite a nice selections including TWSBI, Pilot, and Platinum and also lots of roller and gel pens!

AND they ship into the whole EU for free for orders of ‚Ç¨79 and more üòç
