Similar to [SemVer.org](https://semver.org/) there is also a page for calendar-based versioning or CalVer. Unlike that other page this one does *not* provide a clear recommendation or specification but focuses on how other projects are using dates in their versioning strategy.

I personally especially like those little shield-badges that show what part of a version is used for the date and what for other elements!

Turns out that page has been there for a long time but I simply didn't know about it ðŸ˜…
