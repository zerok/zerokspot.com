> I will continue to remain on the Signal board, committed to helping manifest Signalâ€™s mission from that role, and I will be transitioning out as CEO over the next month in order to focus on the candidate search. Brian Acton, who is also on the Signal Foundation board, has volunteered to serve as interim CEO during the search period.

A big "THANK YOU" for everything you and your team have achieved in the last years. Signal has grown into an essential part of how I communicate with others and the world would be definitely a worse place without it!
