Austrian minister for "Digital and Economic Affairs" [Margarete Schramb√∂ck](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarete_Schramb%C3%B6ck)  explains that [SWIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT) is essential but single transactions can still be made by filling out a paper slip and put it into a box in the back then someone does the transaction manually. I really wonder what she was doing at Austria's largest telecommunication company for all these years...
