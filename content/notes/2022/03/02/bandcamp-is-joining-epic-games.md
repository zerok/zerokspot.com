OK, I definitely didn't see that one coming. Is Epic Games now a general entertainment company? So far it looks like Bandcamp will continue as it is…

> However, behind the scenes we’re working with Epic to expand internationally and push development forward across Bandcamp, from basics like our album pages, mobile apps, merch tools, payment system, and search and discovery features, to newer initiatives like our vinyl pressing and live streaming services.

I really hope that this is true and Bandcamp will just have more money available to expand and get even more attractive. Bandcamp is awesome and I want to see it grow but also to keep its indie feeling …
