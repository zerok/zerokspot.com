In this post Wouter writes about his process/structure of organising scans of journals with Obsidian. This involves basically a JPEG file per page of the journal with some notes around that. 

I really like that idea but I'm a bit afraid of what it would do to the Git repository I keep my Obsidian Vault in right now. A single journal would produce around ... MB of JPEGs.

I might play around with something like that in the future, though. For now, I stop at a single PDF per journal that I keep outside of Obsidian but I'm working on adding a single topic-based index for all my journals in Obsidian so that I can easily find stuff again. Wouter's approach would push that to the next level ðŸ™‚
