> I wish the BahnCard 100 in Germany would be cheaperâ€¦ But congratulations and have fun with climate-friendly travel! ðŸ™‚

Thank you ðŸ˜Š Yeah, ~4000â‚¬ every year is a lot of money. That being said, Germany has obviously a larger railway network than Austria and the BahnCard also includes discounts on tickets even leaving the country, something that the Klimaticket does not include. Still, I believe that the price for the Klimaticket Classic (~1100â‚¬) is at the sweet-spot for something like this. I really hope it will trigger some rethinking in other countries so that others also get a similar offering in the future ðŸ™‚
