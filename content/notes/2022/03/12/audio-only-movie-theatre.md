After a long work-week we decided to watch The Batman last night. Great movie but Cineplexx Graz had some technical issues with the movie stopping in the middle and the being resumed as audio-only experience ðŸ˜¬ After about 30 minutes they managed to fix that but then, 5 minutes before the end, the room lights turned oneâ€¦ The light show was probably part of the â‚¬16 price tag ðŸ¤£
