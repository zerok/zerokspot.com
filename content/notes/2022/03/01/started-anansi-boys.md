On Sunday I finally picked another book that had been on my to-read list for far too long: ["Anansi Boys"](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL679266W/Anansi_Boys) by Neil Gaiman. Since it's available without DRM in the German edition I even decided to read it in German this time around! So far, so very entertaining! There is just always such a nice flow to his books that makes them hard to put down ðŸ˜€
