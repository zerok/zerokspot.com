In a recent statement, Boris Johnson compared the fight of the Ukraine people with Brexit. It's hard to find words to describe that stupidity without requiring insults. Luckily, some EU and UK politicians have already found better words, all summarised in [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/19/pms-comparison-of-ukraine-resistance-to-uk-brexit-vote-criticised-as-crass):

> The SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, described the comparison between people voting to leave the EU and the resistance of Ukrainians to the Russian invasion as “morally repugnant”.
