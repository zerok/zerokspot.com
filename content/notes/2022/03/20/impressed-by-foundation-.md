I continue being impressed by ["Foundation" on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3). While it's only roughly based on the books by Isaac Asimov, the show manages to build an amazing atmosphere. Combine that with awesome tech and acting and you got yourself some awesome Sci-Fi üòç
