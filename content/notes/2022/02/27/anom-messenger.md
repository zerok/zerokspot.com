Somehow I had mostly missed the  story about the ANOM messenger last year! Back in 2018 various law-enforcement agencies throughout the world had launched their own messenger service and marketed it as secure chat service for criminals replacing the Phantom Secure service. In June 2021 the agencies then sprang the trap with more than 800 arrests.

I guess not only governments have a limited degree of IT knowhow ðŸ¤ª
