Thanks to this post by Hyde I did a quick look into the [EMR pens](https://www.lamy.com/en/emr/) that Lamy has released recently. The whole idea here seems to be to bring the tactile feeling of LAMY AL-star and Safari (fountain)pens to digital writing on devices like Wacom tablets.

Sadly, that's just not for me. While I like the feeling those pens (when they don't leak), I don't do so enough for that price point. These EMR pens are also not compatible with any Apple devices (since with [EMR pens are passive devices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lamy/comments/k8ui5c/comment/gf1xezb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) while things like the Apple Pencil are active ones). That being said, at this point I'm doing not all that much handwriting on the tablet, something that might change in the future.

But *if* you do a lot of handwriting on a digital device that is compatible with Lamy's EMR products, this could be something you at least want to try somewhere. They even offer you different nibs for various surface materials!
