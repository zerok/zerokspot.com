> “I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on TRUTH,” Trump said. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH.”

Does anybody actually believe that? My best guess is that Trump's social network won't even be around anymore once the Musk-deal closes and so he will be one of the first to be admitted back to Twitter. For me personally, this would be another nail in the coffin for Twitter but that's a different topic.
