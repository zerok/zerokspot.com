Yesterday evening Twitter's board of directors has announced that they've agreed to sell the company to Elon Musk for 44B USD. Personally, I have a really bad feeling about this, especially thanks to how the term "free speech" is thrown around here by Musk and others but also by the fact that a single person now also owns the platform.
