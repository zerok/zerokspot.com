The Go team just announced that there is now an official vulnerability database and tooling around that for Go. The database can be browsed through <https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/> and there is also a new CLI with [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) which should help developers detect known vulnerabilities in their code.
