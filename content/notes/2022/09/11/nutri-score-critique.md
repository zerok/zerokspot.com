Wouter Groeneveld has posted a great look at the [Nutri-Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutri-Score) system. I never took the time to look into the actual calculation of that score but I was kind of already assuming that it was be rather worthless due to experience with other/similar systems. I also wholeheartedly agree with the suggested approach to just look at the ingredients of a product instead of relying on any "score".
