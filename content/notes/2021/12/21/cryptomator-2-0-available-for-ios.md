The new release finally integrates with the Files app, something that previously prevented me from using [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/). They've also changed the pricing model, going with a free version that can only read encrypted vaults while the full version also offers write-access. € 11.99 for a lifetime account is fair but there are also some offers if you've purchased version 1.x in the past (either free or just €1.99 if you want to make a donation).
