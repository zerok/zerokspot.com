Someone please check the temperature in hell. If they were not owned by Meta I might even consider getting back onto that platform once this "feature" has been launched! At this point, though, Instagram is probably the one user-facing product at Meta with some kind of growth, so that's not going to happen anytime soon ðŸ¤ª
