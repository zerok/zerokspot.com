This post presents a simple system for managing your attention by splitting tasks into 4 categories: quick & easy, cleaning, lengthy/difficult, and finally fun tasks. You'd create a bundle of four tasks with one from each category and do that bundle more or less in one go.

IMO this sounds like a quite nice approach to get your self going and keep motivated ðŸ˜€
